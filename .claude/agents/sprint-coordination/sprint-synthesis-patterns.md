## 📊 Synthesis Pattern Implementations

### Pattern 1: Weighted Progress Aggregation
```bash
# Sophisticated progress weighting system
WEIGHTED_PROGRESS_AGGREGATION:
  weighting_factors:
    story_priority: "{{STORY_PRIORITY_WEIGHT}}%"
    business_value: "{{BUSINESS_VALUE_WEIGHT}}%"
    technical_complexity: "{{COMPLEXITY_WEIGHT}}%"
    dependency_criticality: "{{DEPENDENCY_WEIGHT}}%"
  
  calculation_method:
    total_progress = sum(story_progress * story_weight) / sum(story_weights)
    velocity_adjustment = current_velocity / planned_velocity
    quality_factor = quality_score / quality_threshold
    final_progress = total_progress * velocity_adjustment * quality_factor
```

### Pattern 2: Multi-Stream Velocity Synthesis
```bash
# Comprehensive velocity analysis across streams
MULTI_STREAM_VELOCITY_SYNTHESIS:
  stream_metrics:
    individual_velocity: "points_completed / time_elapsed"
    comparative_performance: "stream_velocity / average_stream_velocity"
    velocity_trend: "current_velocity / historical_average"
    efficiency_ratio: "actual_velocity / theoretical_maximum"
  
  aggregation_logic:
    overall_sprint_velocity = weighted_average(stream_velocities)
    sprint_acceleration = overall_velocity / sequential_baseline
    performance_distribution = analyze_stream_performance_variance()
```

### Pattern 3: Quality-Adjusted Progress Synthesis
```bash
# Progress synthesis with quality considerations
QUALITY_ADJUSTED_SYNTHESIS:
  quality_dimensions:
    code_quality: "{{CODE_QUALITY_WEIGHT}}%"
    test_coverage: "{{TEST_COVERAGE_WEIGHT}}%"
    integration_success: "{{INTEGRATION_WEIGHT}}%"
    defect_rate: "{{DEFECT_RATE_WEIGHT}}%"
  
  adjustment_calculation:
    quality_score = weighted_average(quality_dimensions)
    progress_adjustment = min(quality_score / quality_threshold, 1.0)
    adjusted_progress = raw_progress * progress_adjustment
```

### Pattern 4: Risk-Aware Progress Modeling
```bash
# Progress synthesis with risk factor integration
RISK_AWARE_PROGRESS_MODELING:
  risk_factors:
    active_blockers: "{{BLOCKER_IMPACT_MULTIPLIER}}"
    dependency_delays: "{{DEPENDENCY_DELAY_FACTOR}}"
    integration_complexity: "{{INTEGRATION_RISK_FACTOR}}"
    external_dependencies: "{{EXTERNAL_DEPENDENCY_RISK}}"
  
  risk_adjustment:
    risk_score = calculate_composite_risk_score(risk_factors)
    completion_probability = base_probability * (1 - risk_score)
    adjusted_timeline = planned_timeline * (1 + risk_impact)
```
