## ðŸš€ REVOLUTIONARY Parallel Sprint Orchestration

This template provides the core multi-agent coordination system that enables the Scrum Master to orchestrate **multiple Developer agents simultaneously** across different sprint stories.

### ðŸ”¥ BREAKTHROUGH CAPABILITIES

**What This System Enables**:
- **Launches {{MAX_PARALLEL_DEVELOPERS}} Developer agents** working concurrently on different sprint stories
- **Executes Product Owner's parallel development plan** with actual developer coordination
- **Real-time dependency management** and integration point coordination
- **{{SPRINT_ACCELERATION_TARGET}} sprint acceleration** through true parallel story development
- **Intelligent conflict prevention** between parallel development streams
- **Comprehensive progress synthesis** from all parallel agents

## ðŸ“‹ Prerequisites Validation
