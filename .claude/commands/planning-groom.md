# INTELLIGENT PRODUCT OWNER GROOMING

## üéØ GROOMING PHILOSOPHY

This is **practical grooming** - not heavyweight business analysis. We:
- **Review current state** before making changes
- **Ask clarifying questions** when direction is unclear  
- **Create only what's needed** (no duplicates)
- **Maintain backlog as center of truth**
- **Use established quality standards**

## üîç PHASE 1: CURRENT STATE ANALYSIS

**CRITICAL FIRST STEP**: Before creating anything, understand what exists.

### Step 1: Load Current Backlog State
```markdown
I'm analyzing the current backlog and documentation to understand project direction...

Reading current backlog state:
- Current backlog: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/planning/backlog.md
- Existing epics: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/planning/epics/
- Existing stories: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/planning/stories/
```

### Step 2: Review All Current Documentation  
```markdown
Reviewing comprehensive project documentation:
- Architecture changes: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/architecture/
- Requirements updates: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/requirements/
- Recent reports: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/reports/
- Release notes: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/release-notes/
- Active documentation: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/ACTIVE-DOCUMENTATION-SUMMARY.md
```

### Step 3: Analyze What's Changed
```markdown
Identifying documentation changes and project evolution:
- New features or capabilities documented
- Changed requirements or priorities  
- Technical architecture evolution
- Completed work that affects backlog
- Emerging needs from reports and feedback
```

## ü§î PHASE 2: INTELLIGENT ANALYSIS

### Decision Framework: What Needs Updating?

For each existing epic/story, evaluate:

1. **Still Relevant?** 
   - Does this align with current documentation?
   - Has the project direction changed?
   - Are the requirements still valid?

2. **Correctly Specified?**
   - Do acceptance criteria match current needs?
   - Are story points still accurate?
   - Are dependencies still correct?

3. **Missing Coverage?**
   - What new work is documented but not in backlog?
   - What gaps exist between documentation and stories?

### Critical Decision Points

**WHEN TO PAUSE AND ASK QUESTIONS:**

If any of these conditions exist, STOP and ask the user for clarification:

- **Direction Ambiguity**: Documentation suggests different priorities than current backlog
- **Conflicting Requirements**: New requirements conflict with existing stories  
- **Major Scope Changes**: Documentation implies significant project evolution
- **Resource Implications**: Changes would dramatically affect timeline or effort
- **Technical Uncertainties**: New technical approaches not clearly defined

**Example Clarification Questions:**
```
üö® CLARIFICATION NEEDED üö®

I see potential direction changes based on recent documentation:

1. Current Epic X focuses on [current approach], but recent architecture docs suggest [new approach]. Which direction should we follow?

2. New requirements in [document] seem to conflict with Story Y's acceptance criteria. Should we:
   - Update the story to match new requirements?
   - Keep existing story and create new one?
   - Reassess the requirement priority?

3. The [recent report] indicates [finding] which might affect our backlog priorities. Should this change how we sequence our epics?

Please clarify these points so I can ensure backlog reflects your actual intentions.
```

## üìã PHASE 3: SMART GROOMING EXECUTION  

### Epic Management

**For Existing Epics:**
- Review against current documentation
- Update if direction has changed
- Mark completed if work is done
- Archive if no longer relevant

**For New Epics (CREATE ONLY IF NEEDED):**
- Check: Does this epic already exist in different form?
- Use established format: Epic ID, business justification, success criteria
- Link to supporting documentation
- Follow epic quality standards from checklist

**Epic Quality Validation:**
Use checklist: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/checklists/po-master-checklist.md`

### Story Management

**For Existing Stories:**
- Validate against current acceptance criteria standards
- Update story points if scope changed
- Refresh dependencies based on current state
- Update status based on actual progress

**For New Stories (CREATE ONLY IF NEEDED):**
- Check: Does similar story already exist?
- Use standard format: "As a [user], I want [goal] so that [benefit]"
- Create clear acceptance criteria
- Size appropriately with story points
- Link to parent epic

**Story Quality Validation:**
Use checklist: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/checklists/po-user-story-checklist.md`

## üîó PHASE 4: LINKING & INTEGRATION

### Backlog Integration
```markdown
Updating backlog.md as center of truth:

**[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - PO Smart Grooming Complete**
- Reviewed: [X] epics, [Y] stories against current documentation
- Updated: [Z] existing items for changed requirements  
- Created: [A] new epics, [B] new stories (only where gaps identified)
- Archived: [C] completed/irrelevant items
- Questions: [D] clarification points documented
- Next Review: [Date]
```

### Ensure Proper Linking
- Stories link to parent epics
- Epics link to business objectives
- Dependencies clearly mapped
- Backlog reflects all changes
- Archive outdated items properly
