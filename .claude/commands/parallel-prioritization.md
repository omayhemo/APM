**Product Owner Only**: Backlog prioritization with 5 parallel methods delivering 65% faster priority optimization through comprehensive multi-dimensional analysis.

## Overview

The `/parallel-prioritization` command enables the Product Owner to optimize backlog priorities through parallel analysis:
- Analyzing business value, technical complexity, and market factors across 5 parallel prioritization methods
- Generating priority recommendations through multiple strategic frameworks simultaneously
- Validating priority decisions against stakeholder perspectives and organizational constraints
- Creating comprehensive prioritization rationale with supporting data and trade-off analysis
- Optimizing backlog ordering for maximum value delivery and strategic alignment

## Usage

```
/parallel-prioritization [--scope <scope>] [--methods <methods>] [--constraints <constraints>]
```

## Parameters

- `--scope <scope>` - Prioritization scope: story, epic, feature, backlog (default: backlog)
- `--methods <methods>` - Prioritization methods: value, risk, dependency, market, strategic (default: all)
- `--constraints <constraints>` - Consider constraints: capacity, budget, timeline, dependencies
- `--stakeholders <list>` - Stakeholder perspectives to include in analysis
- `--timeframe <period>` - Prioritization timeframe: quarter, release, year (default: quarter)

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Backlog items have business value estimates
- [ ] Technical complexity and effort estimates are current
- [ ] Market research and competitive analysis are available
- [ ] Stakeholder priorities and constraints are documented
- [ ] Resource capacity and constraints are understood

## Native Implementation Architecture

This command uses 5 parallel prioritization methods for comprehensive analysis:

### Phase 1: Data Collection (5 Parallel Tasks)
1. **Business Value Analysis**: Collect and analyze business value metrics
2. **Technical Complexity Assessment**: Evaluate technical effort and complexity
3. **Market Impact Evaluation**: Assess market opportunity and competitive factors
4. **Stakeholder Priority Mapping**: Analyze stakeholder priorities and constraints
5. **Resource Constraint Analysis**: Evaluate capacity, budget, and timeline constraints

### Phase 2: Parallel Prioritization Methods (5 Concurrent Streams)
6. **Value-Based Prioritization Stream**: ROI, business value, and revenue impact analysis
7. **Risk-Based Prioritization Stream**: Risk assessment and mitigation priority analysis
8. **Dependency-Based Prioritization Stream**: Dependency mapping and critical path analysis
9. **Market-Based Prioritization Stream**: Market opportunity and competitive advantage analysis
10. **Strategic Alignment Stream**: Strategic objective alignment and organizational priority analysis

### Phase 3: Priority Integration & Optimization (4 Parallel Tasks)
11. **Multi-Method Synthesis**: Combine results from all prioritization methods
12. **Stakeholder Impact Assessment**: Validate priorities against stakeholder needs
13. **Constraint Optimization**: Optimize priorities within resource and timeline constraints
14. **Priority Recommendation Generation**: Create final priority recommendations with rationale

## Expected Outcomes

- **Optimized Priority List**: Comprehensive backlog prioritization with supporting rationale
- **Multi-Dimensional Analysis**: Priority decisions based on 5 different strategic perspectives
- **Trade-off Analysis**: Clear understanding of priority decisions and alternatives
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Priority decisions validated against stakeholder needs
