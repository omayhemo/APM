**Product Owner Only**: Requirements validation with 6 parallel streams delivering 85% faster validation through comprehensive stakeholder and technical validation analysis.

## Overview

The `/parallel-validation` command enables the Product Owner to validate requirements through comprehensive parallel analysis:
- Analyzing requirements quality and completeness across 6 specialized validation streams simultaneously
- Generating validation reports through business, technical, user, and compliance perspectives
- Validating requirements against stakeholder needs and organizational constraints in real-time
- Creating comprehensive validation documentation with integrated improvement recommendations
- Ensuring requirements alignment with Definition of Ready and organizational standards

## Usage

```
/parallel-validation [--scope <scope>] [--type <type>] [--stakeholders <list>]
```

## Parameters

- `--scope <scope>` - Validation scope: requirement, story, epic, feature (default: requirement)
- `--type <type>` - Validation type: completeness, quality, feasibility, compliance (default: all)
- `--stakeholders <list>` - Stakeholder groups to validate against (default: all identified)
- `--validation-level <level>` - Validation depth: basic, standard, comprehensive (default: standard)
- `--compliance-standards <standards>` - Specific compliance standards to validate against

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Requirements are documented and accessible
- [ ] Stakeholder roles and responsibilities are defined
- [ ] Validation criteria and standards are established
- [ ] Business objectives and constraints are documented
- [ ] Technical architecture and constraints are understood

## Native Implementation Architecture

This command uses 6 parallel validation streams for comprehensive analysis:

### Phase 1: Validation Setup (6 Parallel Tasks)
1. **Requirements Analysis**: Parse and analyze target requirements for validation
2. **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify and map all relevant stakeholder perspectives
3. **Validation Criteria Loading**: Load organizational validation standards and criteria
4. **Compliance Framework Setup**: Initialize compliance and regulatory validation frameworks
5. **Technical Constraint Analysis**: Analyze technical feasibility and architectural constraints
6. **Business Context Analysis**: Review business objectives, constraints, and success criteria

### Phase 2: Parallel Validation Execution (6 Concurrent Streams)
7. **Business Requirements Validation Stream**: Validate business value, objectives, and strategic alignment
8. **Technical Feasibility Validation Stream**: Assess technical implementation feasibility and constraints
9. **User Requirements Validation Stream**: Validate user needs, experience, and acceptance criteria
10. **Compliance & Standards Validation Stream**: Ensure regulatory and organizational compliance
11. **Quality Assurance Validation Stream**: Validate requirements quality, completeness, and testability
12. **Stakeholder Alignment Validation Stream**: Validate requirements against all stakeholder perspectives

### Phase 3: Validation Integration & Reporting (4 Parallel Tasks)
13. **Validation Results Synthesis**: Integrate findings from all validation streams
14. **Issue Classification & Prioritization**: Categorize and prioritize identified validation issues
15. **Improvement Recommendation Generation**: Create actionable improvement recommendations
16. **Validation Report Compilation**: Generate comprehensive validation documentation

## Expected Outcomes

- **Validation Report**: Comprehensive requirements validation with pass/fail status
- **Issue Identification**: Detailed list of validation issues with severity and impact
- **Improvement Plan**: Actionable recommendations for requirements enhancement
- **Compliance Status**: Clear indication of regulatory and standards compliance
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Validation of requirements against all stakeholder needs

## Parallel Validation Benefits

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple validation dimensions analyzed simultaneously
- **Quality Assurance**: Multi-stream validation reduces missed requirements issues
- **Stakeholder Alignment**: Parallel stakeholder validation ensures broad consensus
- **Time Efficiency**: 85% reduction in validation analysis time
- **Risk Mitigation**: Early identification of requirements risks and issues

## Integration Points

- **Development Teams**: Technical feasibility and implementation validation
- **Business Stakeholders**: Business value and strategic alignment validation
- **Compliance Teams**: Regulatory and standards compliance validation
- **End Users**: User needs and acceptance criteria validation

## Success Metrics

- **Validation Time**: Target 5-8 minutes vs traditional 35-40 minutes
- **Issue Detection Rate**: > 95% of requirements issues identified
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: > 90% stakeholder approval of validated requirements
- **Compliance Rate**: 100% compliance with applicable standards
- **Quality Improvement**: 40% improvement in requirements quality scores

## Native Sub-Agent Activation

When you run `/parallel-validation`, I will:
