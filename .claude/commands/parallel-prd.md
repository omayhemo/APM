## ðŸŽ­ PERSONA CONTEXT ACTIVATION

**This command requires the Product persona.**

```markdown
*Loading Product context for optimal command execution...*

Quick Context Load (1-2 seconds):
- Loading Product configuration and expertise
- Loading relevant templates and frameworks  
- Voice notification: bash $/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakPO.sh "Product context loaded for command execution"
- Workspace validation: Ensuring execution from /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping

*Product context ready. Proceeding with command...*

# PARALLEL PRD CREATION

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute parallel initialization:

```
I'm launching parallel PRD creation with 5 native sub-agents for comprehensive product documentation.

*Executing parallel initialization tasks:*
[Use native sub-agents - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Task 1: Load PM persona from /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/personas/pm.md
- Task 2: Load project brief from /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/requirements/project_brief.md
- Task 3: Load PRD template from /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/templates/prd-tmpl.md
- Task 4: Check for existing PRD at /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/requirements/prd.md
- Task 5: Load market research and competitive analysis if available
```

### Initialization Task Prompts:
1. "Read PM principles, strategic planning methodologies, and PRD best practices"
2. "Extract project vision, goals, and initial requirements from project brief"
3. "Load PRD template structure and required sections"
4. "Check for any existing PRD content to build upon or revise"
5. "Gather market insights, competitive analysis, and user research"

### Post-Initialization:
After ALL tasks complete:
1. Voice announcement: bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakPM.sh "Parallel PRD creation initialized with 5 domain experts"
2. Launch parallel PRD sub-agents

## ðŸš€ PARALLEL PRD GENERATION

### Comprehensive PRD Domains (5 Parallel Sub-Agents)
```
*Launching PRD creation sub-agents:*
[Use native sub-agents - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Sub-Agent 1: Product Vision & Strategy
  Prompt: "Define product vision, strategic objectives, success metrics, market positioning, competitive differentiation, and long-term roadmap. Create compelling value proposition."

- Sub-Agent 2: User Research & Personas
  Prompt: "Develop detailed user personas, user journey maps, pain points analysis, jobs-to-be-done framework, and user experience requirements. Include user research insights."

- Sub-Agent 3: Feature Specification & Prioritization
  Prompt: "Define all features with detailed specifications, user stories, acceptance criteria, and prioritization using MoSCoW. Create feature dependency mapping."

- Sub-Agent 4: Technical Requirements & Architecture
  Prompt: "Document technical requirements, system architecture needs, API specifications, data models, security requirements, and integration points."

- Sub-Agent 5: Go-to-Market & Success Metrics
  Prompt: "Define launch strategy, success metrics, KPIs, adoption targets, revenue projections, and post-launch monitoring plan."
```
