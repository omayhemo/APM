## Command Overview

This command supports both sequential and parallel architecture design approaches:

**Sequential Mode (Default):**

```
I'm launching sequential architecture design for comprehensive system architecture development.

*Loading architecture frameworks and design methodologies...*
[Execute initialization tasks in sequence]
- Load architecture templates and frameworks
- Review system requirements and constraints
- Prepare design methodologies and patterns
- Set up validation and documentation processes
```

### PARALLEL_MODE: Parallel Initialization

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute parallel initialization:

```
I'm initializing the Parallel Architecture Design process. Let me load all required context in parallel for optimal performance.

*Executing parallel initialization tasks:*
