# Installer Cleanup Report - Remove Internal References

## Issue Identified
The installer was exposing internal development terminology (Epic 17) to end users, which is unprofessional and confusing.

## Changes Made

### References Removed
All references to "Epic 17" have been removed from user-facing messages:

| Line | Before | After |
|------|--------|-------|
| 1149 | `# Epic 17 Native Sub-Agents directories` | `# Native Sub-Agents directories` |
| 1184 | `# Deprecated Task-based system removed - Epic 17 complete with native sub-agents only` | `# Deprecated Task-based system removed - native sub-agents only` |
| 1229 | `# Process Epic 17 documentation` | `# Process Native Sub-Agents documentation` |
| 1231 | `Processing Epic 17 Native Sub-Agents Documentation...` | `Processing Native Sub-Agents Documentation...` |
| 1233 | `Epic 17 documentation already installed` | `Documentation already installed` |
| 1235 | `Installing Epic 17 documentation...` | `Installing documentation...` |
| 1244 | `✓ Epic 17 documentation already present` | `✓ Documentation already present` |
| 1246 | `✓ Epic 17 documentation will be available after first run` | `✓ Documentation will be available after first run` |

## Result
The installer now:
- ✅ Uses professional, user-friendly language
- ✅ Focuses on features, not internal development sprints
- ✅ Maintains functionality while improving messaging
- ✅ No longer exposes internal epic/sprint terminology

## Verification
```bash
# Check for any remaining Epic references
grep -n "Epic 17" installer/install.sh
# Result: No matches found ✓

# Check that messages are now clean
grep "Processing.*Documentation" installer/install.sh
# Result: "Processing Native Sub-Agents Documentation..." ✓
```

## Other Findings
The following references are ACCEPTABLE as they refer to actual user commands:
- "epic command" - The /epic command for creating epics
- "next-story command" - The /next-story command for story creation
- "groom-backlog command" - The /groom-backlog command for backlog management
- "sprint" in parallel-sprint command - The /parallel-sprint command

These are user-facing features, not internal development references.

## Summary
All internal development references (Epic 17) have been successfully removed from the installer, making it more professional and user-focused.
