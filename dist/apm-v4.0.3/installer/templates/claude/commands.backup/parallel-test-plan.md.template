### Functional Test Case
```gherkin
Feature: User Authentication
  
Scenario: Valid user login
  Given a registered user with email "user@example.com"
  And password "ValidPassword123"
  When the user attempts to login
  Then the user should be successfully authenticated
  And redirected to the dashboard
  
Scenario: Invalid login attempt
  Given an unregistered email "invalid@example.com"
  When the user attempts to login with any password
  Then login should fail with "Invalid credentials" message
  And user should remain on login page
```

```yaml
test_case:
  name: "Create User API Test"
  method: POST
  endpoint: "/api/users"
  headers:
    Content-Type: "application/json"
    Authorization: "Bearer {token}"
  body:
    name: "Test User"
