# PARALLEL RESEARCH PROMPT GENERATION

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute parallel initialization:

```
I'm launching parallel research prompt generation with 4 native sub-agents for comprehensive research planning.

*Executing parallel initialization tasks:*
[Use native sub-agents - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Task 1: Load Analyst persona from {{AP_ROOT}}/personas/analyst.md
- Task 2: Load existing research context from {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/project_docs/research/
- Task 3: Load deep research prompt template from {{AP_ROOT}}/tasks/create-deep-research-prompt.md
- Task 4: Check for project brief and requirements documentation
- Task 5: Load market research and competitive analysis frameworks
```

### Initialization Task Prompts:
1. "Read analyst research methodologies and prompt engineering best practices"
2. "Scan existing research documents for context and gaps"
3. "Load research prompt templates and structure guidelines"
4. "Extract project context, goals, and key questions from documentation"
5. "Load research frameworks for market, competitive, and user analysis"

### Post-Initialization:
After ALL tasks complete:
1. Voice announcement: bash {{AP_ROOT}}/voice/speakAnalyst.sh "Parallel research prompt generation initialized with 4 domain experts"
2. Launch parallel prompt generation sub-agents

## ðŸš€ PARALLEL PROMPT GENERATION

### Research Domain Streams (4 Parallel Sub-Agents)
```
*Launching research prompt generation sub-agents:*
[Use native sub-agents - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Sub-Agent 1: Research Objectives & Methodology
  Prompt: "Define clear research objectives, questions, hypotheses, and methodologies. Specify data collection methods, analysis frameworks, and validation criteria. Include success metrics."

- Sub-Agent 2: Information Sources & Data Requirements
  Prompt: "Identify all potential information sources including primary research, secondary sources, databases, APIs, expert interviews, and user research. Define data quality requirements."

- Sub-Agent 3: Analysis Framework & Output Structure
  Prompt: "Design analysis frameworks, evaluation criteria, comparison matrices, and output templates. Define how findings will be structured, visualized, and presented."

- Sub-Agent 4: Validation & Quality Control
  Prompt: "Establish validation methods, fact-checking protocols, bias mitigation strategies, and quality assurance criteria. Define confidence levels and uncertainty handling."
```
