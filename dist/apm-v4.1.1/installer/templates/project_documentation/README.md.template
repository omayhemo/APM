# Project Documentation Structure - Coherence v{{VERSION}}

This directory contains all project-specific documentation generated and used by the Coherence - Agentic Persona Mapping Framework agents with **native sub-agent architecture**, **unified context engineering**, and **MCP Plopdock integration** for 4-8x faster documentation generation.

## Directory Structure

### base/
Core project documents that serve as the foundation for all development work:
- `prd.md` - Product Requirements Document (created by PM agent)
- `architecture.md` - System Architecture Document (created by Architect agent)
- `frontend-architecture.md` - Frontend Architecture Document (created by Design Architect)
- `project_structure.md` - Project file/folder organization
- `development_workflow.md` - Development process and workflows
- `tech_stack.md` - Technology stack and dependencies
- `data-models.md` - Data structures and models
- `environment-vars.md` - Environment variable documentation

### epics/
Contains epic-level documentation:
- `epic-{n}.md` - Individual epic documents
- `epic-orchestration-guide.md` - Guide for managing epics

### stories/
User story documentation:
- `{epicNum}.{storyNum}.story.md` - Individual story files
- Stories are generated from epics by the SM agent

### qa/
Quality assurance documentation:
- `test-strategy.md` - Overall testing strategy
- `test-plan.md` - Detailed test plans
- `test-report.md` - Test execution reports
- `automation-plan.md` - Test automation plans
- `deployment-plan.md` - Deployment procedures
- `test-plans/` - Individual test plan documents
- `automation/` - Automation scripts and documentation

### index.md
Master index linking all documentation for easy navigation.

## Usage by Agents (v{{VERSION}} - Native Sub-Agent Enhanced)

- **Analyst**: Parallel research and analysis with native sub-agents and unified context engineering
- **PM**: Concurrent PRD generation and epic management (4x speedup) with Coherence methodology
- **Architect**: `/parallel-architecture-review` for system-wide analysis using unified context patterns
- **Design Architect**: Parallel component and UI/UX analysis with Coherence design principles
- **PO**: `/groom` with 18 native sub-agents for backlog optimization using unified context engineering
- **SM**: `/parallel-sprint` coordinating 2-4 Developer sub-agents with Coherence coordination patterns
- **Developer**: `/parallel-review` for concurrent code analysis with unified context sharing
- **QA**: `/parallel-test` with AI/ML analytics (92% accuracy) and Coherence validation frameworks

**Performance Impact**: Documentation generation now 4-8x faster with zero CLI crashes through Coherence optimization and unified context engineering

## MCP Plopdock Integration (v{{VERSION}} - Epic 26)

### Development Documentation Requirements

When documenting development server management, agents MUST reference MCP tools instead of direct commands:

**Documentation Standards:**
- **Setup Guides**: Always reference `start_dev_server` MCP tool
- **Deployment Docs**: Include MCP server management workflows
- **Development Workflow**: Document MCP-based development process
- **Troubleshooting**: MCP server diagnostics and log access via `server_logs`

**Real-time Documentation:**
- **Server Status**: Live updates via http://localhost:2601 dashboard
- **Log Integration**: Automatic log capture and documentation
- **Persistent Sessions**: Document survival across Claude Code restarts
