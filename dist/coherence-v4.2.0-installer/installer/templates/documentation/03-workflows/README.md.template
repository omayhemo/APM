# Coherence Workflow Patterns Overview

## Introduction

Coherence - Agentic Persona Mapping provides unified context engineering workflows for software development, project management, and team collaboration. This directory contains comprehensive workflow documentation for maximizing Coherence methodology effectiveness through orchestrated intelligence.

## Available Workflow Patterns

### ðŸ“‹ Core Development Workflows
- **[Unified Context Engineering Workflow](typical-project-flow.md)** - Coherent software development lifecycle
- **[Idea to Implementation](idea-to-implementation.md)** - Complete unified context engineering journey from concept to deployed code
- **[Parallel Development](parallel-development.md)** - Leveraging native sub-agents for 4-8x performance gains through coherent orchestration

### ðŸ”„ Session & Continuity Management
- **[Session Management](session-management.md)** - Work session handling with unified context preservation and seamless integration
- **[Handoff Patterns](handoff-patterns.md)** - Agent transition protocols with coherent transitions and best practices

### ðŸ“Š Project Management Workflows
- **[Backlog Workflow](backlog-workflow.md)** - Unified context engineering backlog management patterns
- **[Team Collaboration](team-collaboration.md)** - Multi-user coordination with orchestrated intelligence and communication patterns

## Workflow Selection Guide

### Choose Your Workflow Based On:

**Project Size:**
- **Small Projects (1-4 weeks)**: Use Unified Context Engineering Workflow
- **Medium Projects (1-6 months)**: Use Idea to Implementation + Session Management with coherent workflow
- **Large Projects (6+ months)**: Combine all patterns with Team Collaboration using orchestrated intelligence

**Team Size:**
- **Solo Developer**: Focus on Session Management + Parallel Development
- **Small Team (2-5 people)**: Add Handoff Patterns + Backlog Workflow
- **Large Team (6+ people)**: Full Team Collaboration workflow required

**Performance Requirements:**
- **Standard Development**: Use sequential persona activation
- **High-Performance Needs**: Implement Parallel Development patterns (4-8x speedup)
- **Critical Timelines**: Combine parallel execution with aggressive session management

## Performance Optimization Strategy

### Native Sub-Agent Architecture (v4.1.0)
Coherence v4.1.0 delivers revolutionary performance through native sub-agent parallelism with unified context engineering:

- **4-8x Performance Improvement**: Native execution eliminates CLI bottlenecks
- **True Concurrency**: Multiple personas execute simultaneously
- **Zero CLI Crashes**: Rock-solid integration with Claude Code
- **Intelligent Coordination**: Automatic dependency resolution between parallel streams

### When to Use Parallel Patterns
- **Complex User Stories**: Stories with multiple acceptance criteria
- **Multi-Component Features**: Frontend + Backend + Database work
- **Cross-Cutting Concerns**: Security, performance, testing requirements
- **Time-Critical Deliverables**: Tight deadlines requiring maximum throughput

## Common Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### ðŸš« Don't Do This
- **Session Note Neglect**: Failing to maintain continuous session documentation
- **Backlog Abandonment**: Not updating backlog.md after story work
- **Sequential Bias**: Using single personas when parallel execution is available
- **Context Loss**: Switching personas without proper handoff protocols
- **Over-Orchestration**: Using Coherence Orchestrator for simple single-persona tasks

### âœ… Do This Instead
- **Continuous Documentation**: Update session notes every 10-15 minutes with unified context preservation
- **Backlog Discipline**: Update backlog.md immediately after any story work using coherent workflow principles
- **Parallel Thinking**: Default to parallel patterns for multi-component work with orchestrated intelligence
- **Structured Handoffs**: Follow coherent transition protocols for seamless integration
- **Right-Sized Orchestration**: Use Coherence Orchestrator for focused work coordination

## Getting Started

1. **New to Coherence**: Start with [Unified Context Engineering Workflow](typical-project-flow.md)
2. **Performance Focus**: Jump to [Parallel Development](parallel-development.md) with orchestrated intelligence
3. **Team Environment**: Begin with [Team Collaboration](team-collaboration.md) using coherent workflow patterns
4. **Complex Project**: Use [Idea to Implementation](idea-to-implementation.md) unified context engineering journey

## Workflow Integration Examples

### Example 1: Feature Development
```
User Story â†’ /parallel-stories â†’ /parallel-test-plan â†’ /parallel-validation
Performance: 4-6x faster than sequential execution
```

### Example 2: Bug Investigation
```
/qa â†’ Investigate â†’ /analyst â†’ Root cause â†’ /dev â†’ Fix â†’ /qa â†’ Verify
Session Management: Unified context engineering preserves debugging context with seamless integration
```

### Example 3: Architecture Planning
```
/coherence â†’ Plan â†’ /architect â†’ Design â†’ /design-architect â†’ UI â†’ /parallel-validation
Coordination: Coherence Orchestrator ensures alignment across design disciplines
```

## Success Metrics

### Performance Indicators
- **Development Velocity**: Story completion rate per sprint
- **Parallel Efficiency**: Speedup ratio (target: 4-8x for complex features)
- **Context Continuity**: Session handoff success rate
- **Quality Metrics**: Defect density, test coverage improvements

### Process Health
- **Session Note Quality**: Completeness and continuity scores
- **Backlog Currency**: How current backlog.md reflects actual work
- **Agent Utilization**: Optimal persona selection rate
- **Collaboration Effectiveness**: Multi-user coordination success
