## üö® Critical Installation Problems

### Issue: Coherence Commands Not Recognized

**Symptoms:**
- `/coherence` command returns "command not found" (legacy `/ap` still supported)
- No Coherence personas available
- Installation appears incomplete

**Immediate Solutions for Coherence:**

1. **Verify Installation Location**
```bash
# Check if Coherence is installed
ls -la {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/
```

2. **Re-run Installation**
```bash
# Complete reinstallation
cd {{PROJECT_ROOT}}
./payload/install.sh --force
```

3. **Manual Command Registration**
```bash
# Direct command copy
cp {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.claude/commands/* ~/.claude/commands/
source ~/.bashrc  # or ~/.zshrc
```

### Issue: Voice System Failure

**Symptoms:**
- No audio notifications during persona activation
- Silent Coherence interactions
- TTS errors in logs

**Quick Fixes:**

1. **Check Audio System**
```bash
# Test system audio
echo "test" | espeak  # or say "test" on macOS
```

2. **Reconfigure TTS Provider**
```bash
{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/agents/voice/configure-tts.sh --provider system
```

3. **Disable Voice (Temporary)**
```bash
export COHERENCE_VOICE_ENABLED=false
/coherence  # Should work without audio (legacy /ap still supported)
```

## ‚ö° Performance Degradation

### Slow Command Execution

**If Coherence commands take >30 seconds:**

1. **Check Native Sub-Agent Mode**
```bash
# Verify no Task tool dependencies
grep -r "Task tool" {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/agents/
```
**Expected:** No results (native mode active)

2. **Enable Performance Monitoring**
```bash
export COHERENCE_DEBUG_MODE=true
export COHERENCE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
/coherence  # Monitor execution time (legacy /ap still supported)
```

3. **Resource Optimization**
```bash
# Check system resources
htop  # Look for high CPU/memory usage
```

**Performance Standards (Coherence v4.1.0):**
- **Command Response**: <5 seconds
- **Parallel Execution**: 4-8x speedup
- **Memory Usage**: <512MB per persona
- **Native Integration**: Zero crashes

## üõ†Ô∏è Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### 1. Session Notes Not Creating

**Problem:** Empty session notes directory after Coherence persona activation

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Check permissions
chmod 755 {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/session_notes/

# Initialize manually
/session-note-setup

# Verify path configuration
cat {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/config/paths.json
```

#### 2. Context Loss Between Sessions

**Problem:** Personas don't remember previous work

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Always read latest session notes
ls -la {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/session_notes/
# Read the most recent non-archived file

# Use proper handoffs
/handoff developer  # Preserves context
# Instead of direct activation: /dev
```

#### 3. Parallel Execution Not Working

**Problem:** Multiple personas running sequentially instead of concurrently

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Verify Coherence v4.1.0 native mode
cat {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/VERSION
# Should show v4.1.0 or higher

# Check for deprecated Task dependencies
find {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm -name "*.md" -exec grep -l "Task tool" {} \;
# Should return no results
```

#### 4. Persona Behavior Inconsistencies

**Problem:** Personas not following expected behavioral patterns

**Solutions:**
```bash
# Read current persona rules
ls -la {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/rules/
cat {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/rules/[relevant-rule-file].md

# Update persona definitions if needed
{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/installer/generate-personas.sh
```

### Advanced Troubleshooting

#### Debug Mode Activation

```bash
# Enable comprehensive debugging
export COHERENCE_DEBUG_MODE=true
export COHERENCE_VERBOSE_LOGGING=true
export COHERENCE_TRACE_EXECUTION=true

# Run problematic command with full logging
/coherence 2>&1 | tee coherence-debug.log
```

#### Log Analysis

```bash
# Check Coherence logs
tail -f {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/logs/apm.log

# System logs (macOS)
log show --predicate 'subsystem contains "com.anthropic.claude"' --last 1h

# System logs (Linux)
journalctl -f | grep -i claude
```

## ‚ùì Frequently Asked Questions

### General Questions

**Q: How is Coherence different from regular AI assistants?**
A: Coherence provides specialized AI personas optimized for specific development roles through unified context engineering, with native parallel execution delivering 4-8x performance improvements and seamless context preservation.

**Q: Can I use Coherence with existing projects?**
A: Yes! Coherence integrates with any codebase through unified context engineering. Simply run the installer in your project root, and Coherence will adapt to your existing structure.

**Q: Does Coherence require specific programming languages?**
A: No. Coherence personas work with any technology stack through unified context engineering - JavaScript, Python, Java, C#, Go, Rust, and more.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why are my commands slow in Coherence v4.1.0?**
A: Coherence v4.1.0 uses native sub-agents for 4-8x speedup through unified context engineering. Slow performance indicates Task tool dependencies weren't fully removed. Run `grep -r "Task tool" .apm/` to identify remaining dependencies.

**Q: How do I customize persona behavior?**
A: Edit persona definitions in `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/.apm/agents/personas/` and regenerate with `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/installer/generate-personas.sh`.

**Q: Can I create custom personas?**
A: Yes! Follow the persona template in `{{PROJECT_ROOT}}/installer/templates/agents/personas/` and add your custom persona to the generation process.

### Workflow Questions

**Q: When should I use /coherence vs direct persona activation?**
A: Always start with `/coherence` for new sessions or complex tasks (legacy `/ap` still supported). Use direct activation (`/dev`, `/qa`) only for simple, single-persona tasks.

**Q: How do I handle long-running development sessions?**
A: Use `/handoff [persona]` for context-preserving transitions and `/wrap` to properly archive sessions before ending.

**Q: What's the difference between /handoff and /switch?**
A: `/handoff` preserves full context, while `/switch` compacts the session before transitioning (useful for memory optimization).

## üí° Best Practices

### Optimization Tips

**1. Start Every Session with Orchestrator**
```bash
/coherence  # Provides optimal workflow planning through unified context engineering
```

**2. Leverage Parallel Commands for Complex Tasks**
```bash
/parallel-sprint     # Multiple developers
/parallel-qa-framework  # Comprehensive testing
```

**3. Maintain Context Continuity**
```bash
# Always read previous session notes
# Use proper handoffs instead of direct activation
# Update session notes throughout work
```

**4. Monitor Performance**
```bash
export COHERENCE_PERFORMANCE_MONITORING=true
# Track 4-8x acceleration metrics
```

### Anti-Patterns to Avoid

**‚ùå Sequential Persona Usage**
```bash
# WRONG: Wait for each persona to complete
/dev ‚Üí wait ‚Üí /qa ‚Üí wait ‚Üí /architect
```

**‚úÖ Parallel Execution**
```bash
# CORRECT: Use parallel commands
/parallel-sprint  # All personas work concurrently
```

**‚ùå Ignoring Session Notes**
- Starting sessions without reading context
- Not updating progress during work
- Failing to archive completed sessions

**‚úÖ Proper Session Management**
- Read latest notes on activation
- Update continuously during work
- Archive with `/wrap` when complete
