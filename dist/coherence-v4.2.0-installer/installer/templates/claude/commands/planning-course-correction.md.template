## ðŸŽ­ PERSONA CONTEXT ACTIVATION

**This command requires the Scrum Master persona.**

```markdown
*Loading Scrum Master context for course-correction...*

Quick Context Load (1-2 seconds):
- Loading Scrum Master configuration and expertise
- Loading relevant templates and frameworks
- PARALLEL_MODE: Preparing parallel execution framework
- SEQUENTIAL_MODE: Standard context loading
- Workspace validation: Ensuring execution from {{PROJECT_ROOT}}

*Context ready. Choose execution mode...*
```

## Command Overview

This command supports both sequential and parallel execution:

**Sequential Mode (Default):**
- Focused, guided methodology with deep analysis
- Interactive stakeholder engagement
- Systematic validation and documentation
- Quality-focused approach

**Parallel Mode (--parallel flag):**
- Multiple native sub-agents working simultaneously  
- 65% performance improvement
- Comprehensive parallel coverage
- Speed-optimized execution

## Usage

```
/planning-course-correction [--parallel]
```

**Parameters:**
- `--parallel`: Execute with parallel sub-agents for faster completion
- Default: Sequential execution with guided methodology

## SEQUENTIAL_MODE: Sequential Process

```
/planning-course-correction
```

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Context and objectives are clearly understood
- [ ] Stakeholder requirements are identified
- [ ] Existing documentation has been reviewed
- [ ] Success criteria are established
- [ ] Resources and constraints are known

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute initialization:

```
I'm launching sequential course-correction for comprehensive development and analysis.

*Loading course-correction templates and methodologies...*
[Execute initialization tasks in sequence]
- Load course-correction templates and frameworks
- Review context and requirements
- Prepare systematic methodology
- Set up validation and documentation processes
```

## Sequential Course-correction Process

### Phase 1: Foundation & Context (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Establish foundation and understand requirements
- Context analysis and requirement gathering
- Stakeholder identification and needs assessment
- Success criteria definition and scope establishment
- Constraint identification and planning considerations

### Phase 2: Development & Analysis (20-30 minutes) 
**Objective**: Execute core course-correction activities
- Systematic development following proven methodologies
- Interactive refinement and stakeholder engagement
- Quality validation and completeness checking
- Iterative improvement based on feedback

### Phase 3: Validation & Refinement (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Ensure quality and completeness
- Comprehensive validation against requirements
- Stakeholder review and feedback incorporation
- Quality assurance and standards compliance
- Final documentation and deliverable preparation

## Expected Outcomes

After course-correction completion:
- **Comprehensive deliverables** meeting all requirements
- **Quality assurance** with validation completed
- **Stakeholder alignment** with approval obtained
- **Clear documentation** with rationale and decisions
- **Implementation readiness** with next steps defined
