# Native Sub-Agent State Tracking

## Simple State Management Through Natural Language

### State Definitions

1. **Initializing**: Agent is starting up and understanding the task
2. **Active**: Agent is actively working on the assigned task
3. **Completing**: Agent is finalizing work and preparing results
4. **Terminated**: Agent has finished and provided results
5. **Failed**: Agent encountered an error and cannot continue

### State Transition Patterns

#### Agent Self-Reporting Pattern
Each sub-agent naturally reports its state:

```
[Agent Type] Agent Status Update:
- State: Initializing
- Task: "Implement user authentication for Story 17.1"
- Understanding requirements and setting up workspace...

[Agent Type] Agent Status Update:
- State: Active
- Progress: Creating authentication service module
- Completed: Project setup, dependency installation
- Current: Writing login/logout logic

[Agent Type] Agent Status Update:
- State: Completing
- Finalizing: Running tests, updating documentation
- Results ready in: ~1 minute

[Agent Type] Agent Status Update:
- State: Terminated
- Results: Authentication module complete
- Files: auth.service.js, auth.test.js, README.md
- All tests passing, ready for integration
```

### Coordinator State Tracking

#### Simple Tracking Table
The coordinator maintains awareness through natural language:

```
Current Sub-Agent Status:
┌─────────────┬──────────────────────────┬─────────────┬──────────┐
│ Agent       │ Task                     │ State       │ Duration │
├─────────────┼──────────────────────────┼─────────────┼──────────┤
│ Developer 1 │ Story 17.1 - Auth Module │ Active      │ 2:30     │
│ Developer 2 │ Story 17.2 - API Routes  │ Active      │ 2:15     │
│ QA Agent    │ Test Strategy Creation   │ Completing  │ 3:45     │
│ Architect   │ Integration Review       │ Terminated  │ 2:00     │
└─────────────┴──────────────────────────┴─────────────┴──────────┘
```

#### Progress Monitoring
```
Parallel Execution Progress:
- Total Agents: 4
- Active: 2
- Completing: 1  
- Terminated: 1
- Failed: 0
- Estimated completion: 2-3 minutes
```

### Timeout Protection Implementation

#### Setting Timeouts
```
Agent activation with timeout:
"I need a Developer agent to implement the user profile feature.
This should take approximately 10 minutes.
Please provide a status update every 3 minutes.
Alert me if you need more than 12 minutes."
```

#### Timeout Warnings
```
⚠️ Timeout Warning:
- Agent: Developer 2
- Task: API Routes Implementation
- Elapsed: 9 minutes (90% of estimated time)
- State: Still Active
- Action: Checking with agent for completion estimate
```

#### Timeout Handling
```
🔴 Timeout Reached:
- Agent: Developer 2
- Task: API Routes Implementation
- Elapsed: 12 minutes (timeout exceeded)
- Last State: Active
- Action: Requesting immediate status and partial results
- Fallback: Will terminate at 15 minutes with partial work
```

### State Synchronization

#### Coordination Points
```
Synchronization checkpoint reached:
- All agents should be at least 50% complete
- Current status:
  - Developer 1: 60% (on track)
  - Developer 2: 45% (slightly behind)
  - QA Agent: 55% (on track)
  - Architect: 100% (complete)
- Proceeding with sync discussions...
```

#### Dependency Management
```
Dependency Status:
- Developer 1 (Auth): Ready for integration
- Developer 2 (API): Waiting for auth token format
- Resolution: Developer 1 sharing interface definition
- Blocker cleared: Developer 2 can proceed
```

### Health Monitoring

#### Agent Health Checks
```
Performing health check on active agents:
✅ Developer 1: Responsive, making progress
✅ Developer 2: Responsive, cleared blocker
✅ QA Agent: Responsive, nearing completion
✅ System: No CLI issues, all agents stable
```

#### Performance Metrics
```
Real-time Performance:
- Agents spawned: 4 in 6 seconds
- Average spawn time: 1.5 seconds
- Memory usage: Normal
- CLI stability: Excellent
- True parallelism: Confirmed (all agents have separate contexts)
```

### State Recovery Patterns

#### Graceful Degradation
```
Agent failure detected, implementing recovery:
1. Failed Agent: Developer 3 (database module)
2. Failure Type: Connection timeout
3. Recovery Actions:
   - Collecting partial work completed
   - Reassigning critical tasks to Developer 1
   - Adjusting timeline estimates
   - Continuing with remaining agents
```

#### Checkpoint Recovery
```
Recovery from checkpoint:
- Last checkpoint: 5 minutes ago
- State at checkpoint: All agents at 40% completion
- Current state: 3 of 4 agents at 70% completion
- Recovery plan: Restart failed agent from 40% point
```

### State Reporting Templates

#### Minimal Status
```
Quick Status: Dev1[Active] Dev2[Active] QA[Completing] Arch[Done]
```

#### Detailed Status
```
Detailed Agent Status Report:

Developer Agent 1:
- State: Active
- Task: User authentication module
- Started: 10:15 AM
- Progress: 70% complete
- Current: Writing unit tests
- Blockers: None
- ETA: 3 minutes

Developer Agent 2:
- State: Active
- Task: API route handlers
- Started: 10:15 AM
- Progress: 65% complete
- Current: Implementing error handling
- Blockers: None
- ETA: 4 minutes

[Continue for all agents...]
```

#### Executive Summary
```
Parallel Execution Summary:
- Operation: Sprint 18 Development
- Total Agents: 4
- Success Rate: 100%
- Time Saved: 12 minutes (75% reduction)
- Quality: All tests passing
- Integration: Ready
```

### State Persistence

#### Session State Capture
```
Saving parallel execution state:
- Timestamp: 2024-01-25 10:30:00
- Active Agents: 4
- States: [Active, Active, Completing, Terminated]
- Tasks: [Auth, API, Tests, Review]
- Checkpoint saved to: session_notes/parallel_execution_sprint18.md
```

#### State Restoration
```
Restoring previous session state:
- Found 2 agents were active
- Tasks 60% and 70% complete
- Resuming with status check
- Agents responsive, continuing work
```

### Integration with Result Synthesis

#### State-Aware Result Collection
```
Collecting results based on agent states:
- Terminated agents (2): Full results available
- Completing agents (1): Preliminary results available
- Active agents (1): Progress report only
- Failed agents (0): N/A

Results will be updated as agents complete.
```

This state tracking system provides simple, natural language-based monitoring without complex infrastructure, perfectly suited for Claude's native sub-agent capabilities.
