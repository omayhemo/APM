    // API: Verify user doesn't exist
    const apiResponse = await request.get('/api/users/check');
    
    // UI: Complete registration
    await page.goto('/register');
    await page.fill('#email', 'user@example.com');
    
    // API: Verify user was created
    const createdUser = await request.get('/api/users/current');
