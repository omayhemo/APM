⚠️  WARNING: DO NOT MODIFY FILES IN THIS DIRECTORY ⚠️

The .apm directory contains the AP Mapping framework files.
These files are managed by the installer and ap-manager.sh.

ANY MODIFICATIONS TO THESE FILES WILL BE LOST:
- During updates (ap-manager.sh update)
- During repairs (ap-manager.sh repair)  
- During reinstallation

If you need to customize behavior:
- Use project_docs/ for your project documentation
- Use .claude/settings.json for configuration
- Use session_notes/ for your working notes (preserved during repairs)

For framework issues:
- Run: ap-manager.sh verify    (to check installation)
- Run: ap-manager.sh repair    (to fix corrupted files)
- Run: ap-manager.sh update    (to get latest version)

The ONLY directory preserved during repairs is:
- .apm/session_notes/

All other files in .apm will be replaced with fresh versions.
