# Parallel Course Correction (Native Sub-Agent Implementation)

**Scrum Master Only**: Sprint adjustment analysis with 5 parallel streams delivering 65% faster sprint course correction through comprehensive impact analysis and solution generation.

## Overview

The `/parallel-course-correction` command enables the Scrum Master to rapidly analyze and address sprint deviations:
- Identifying root causes of sprint issues through parallel analysis streams
- Generating multiple correction strategies simultaneously
- Assessing impact and feasibility of adjustment options in real-time
- Creating comprehensive course correction plans with stakeholder communication
- Implementing corrections with minimal sprint disruption and maximum value preservation

## Usage

```
/parallel-course-correction [--severity <level>] [--focus <area>] [--implement]
```

## Parameters

- `--severity <level>` - Issue severity: minor, moderate, critical, emergency (default: auto-detect)
- `--focus <area>` - Focus area: scope, timeline, quality, team, dependencies (default: all)
- `--implement` - Automatically implement low-risk corrections
- `--stakeholders <list>` - Stakeholder notification list for communication
- `--sprint <number>` - Target sprint number (default: current sprint)

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Sprint progress is documented and current
- [ ] Team velocity and capacity data is available
- [ ] Sprint backlog and story status are up-to-date
- [ ] Blocker and impediment documentation is current
- [ ] Stakeholder contact information is available

## Native Implementation Architecture

This command uses 5 parallel streams for comprehensive course correction:

### Phase 1: Issue Analysis (5 Parallel Tasks)
1. **Sprint Health Assessment**: Analyze current sprint metrics and progress
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Identify underlying causes of sprint deviations
3. **Impact Assessment**: Evaluate effects on current and future sprints
4. **Stakeholder Impact Analysis**: Assess impact on stakeholders and commitments
5. **Historical Pattern Analysis**: Review similar past issues and resolutions

### Phase 2: Solution Generation (5 Concurrent Streams)
6. **Scope Adjustment Stream**: Generate scope modification strategies
7. **Timeline Optimization Stream**: Create timeline adjustment options
8. **Resource Reallocation Stream**: Develop team and resource redistribution plans
9. **Quality Compromise Stream**: Assess quality trade-offs and mitigation strategies
10. **Stakeholder Communication Stream**: Prepare stakeholder notification and negotiation strategies

### Phase 3: Implementation Planning (4 Parallel Tasks)
11. **Solution Evaluation**: Assess feasibility and risk of each correction option
12. **Implementation Planning**: Create detailed correction implementation plans
13. **Communication Strategy**: Develop stakeholder communication and change management
14. **Success Metrics Definition**: Establish measurements for correction effectiveness

    scope_adjustment: true
    timeline_extension: true
    resource_augmentation: true
    quality_tradeoffs: false  # Disabled by default
