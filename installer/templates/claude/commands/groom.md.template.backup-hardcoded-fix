# PRODUCT OWNER BACKLOG GROOMING

## 🚀 INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute parallel initialization:

```
I'm activating comprehensive backlog grooming with 18 parallel sub-agents for maximum efficiency.

*Executing parallel grooming tasks:*
[Use Task tool - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Task 1: Load Product Owner persona from /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/personas/po.md
- Task 2: Load current backlog from /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/backlog.md
- Task 3: Analyze story dependencies and relationships
- Task 4: Assess technical debt and optimization opportunities
- Task 5: Generate epic recommendations and story breakdowns
```

### Initialization Task Prompts:
1. "Read and extract Product Owner principles, backlog management protocols, and grooming strategies"
2. "Load complete backlog, analyze all stories, epics, and their current status"
3. "Map all story dependencies, identify blockers, and create dependency graph"
4. "Analyze technical debt items, identify optimization opportunities, assess impact"
5. "Generate recommendations for new epics, story breakdowns, and prioritization"

### Post-Initialization:
After ALL tasks complete:
1. Voice announcement: bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakPo.sh "Backlog grooming initialized with 18 parallel analysis streams"
2. Launch parallel grooming sub-agents

## 🚀 PARALLEL GROOMING EXECUTION

### Phase 1: Domain Analysis (6 Parallel Sub-Agents)
```
*Launching domain analysis sub-agents:*
[Use Task tool - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Sub-Agent 1: Business Value Analysis - Assess ROI and business impact
- Sub-Agent 2: Domain Modeling - Analyze domain boundaries and contexts
- Sub-Agent 3: Feature Extraction - Identify feature opportunities
- Sub-Agent 4: Integration Analysis - Map integration points and dependencies
- Sub-Agent 5: Compliance Review - Check regulatory and security requirements
- Sub-Agent 6: Risk Assessment - Identify and quantify project risks
```

### Phase 2: Story Generation (6 Parallel Sub-Agents)
```
*Launching story generation sub-agents:*
[Use Task tool - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Sub-Agent 7: Feature Epic Generation - Create feature-focused epics
- Sub-Agent 8: Technical Epic Generation - Create technical/infrastructure epics
- Sub-Agent 9: Compliance Epic Generation - Create compliance/security epics
- Sub-Agent 10: Story Breakdown - Decompose epics into actionable stories
- Sub-Agent 11: Story Sizing - Estimate story points using Fibonacci
- Sub-Agent 12: Dependency Mapping - Create comprehensive dependency graph
```

### Phase 3: Optimization & Planning (6 Parallel Sub-Agents)
```
*Launching optimization sub-agents:*
[Use Task tool - ALL in single function_calls block]
- Sub-Agent 13: Sprint Allocation - Optimize story distribution across sprints
- Sub-Agent 14: Capacity Planning - Balance team capacity with story points
- Sub-Agent 15: Parallel Stream Planning - Identify parallel development opportunities
- Sub-Agent 16: Technical Debt Analysis - Prioritize debt paydown
- Sub-Agent 17: Business Value Optimization - Maximize ROI through prioritization
- Sub-Agent 18: Compliance Scheduling - Ensure regulatory deadlines are met
```
