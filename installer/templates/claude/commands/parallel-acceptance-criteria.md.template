**Product Owner Only**: Acceptance criteria definition with 4 parallel streams delivering 80% faster criteria development through comprehensive validation and testing perspectives.

## Overview

The `/parallel-acceptance-criteria` command enables the Product Owner to create comprehensive acceptance criteria through parallel analysis:
- Analyzing user scenarios and business requirements across 4 specialized streams simultaneously
- Generating testable, specific, and measurable acceptance criteria from multiple perspectives
- Validating criteria completeness and testability in real-time across technical and user dimensions
- Creating comprehensive criteria documentation with integrated testing strategies
- Ensuring criteria alignment with Definition of Done and quality standards

## Usage

```
/parallel-acceptance-criteria [--story-id <id>] [--scope <scope>] [--validation-level <level>]
```

## Parameters

- `--story-id <id>` - Target story ID for criteria generation (default: current active story)
- `--scope <scope>` - Criteria scope: functional, non-functional, all (default: all)
- `--validation-level <level>` - Validation depth: basic, comprehensive, exhaustive (default: comprehensive)
- `--personas <list>` - User personas to consider for criteria (default: all story personas)
- `--testing-focus <focus>` - Testing focus: manual, automated, both (default: both)

## Native Implementation Architecture

This command uses 4 parallel streams for comprehensive acceptance criteria generation:

### Phase 1: Requirements Analysis (4 Parallel Tasks)
1. **User Scenario Analysis**: Map user scenarios and interaction patterns
2. **Business Requirements Analysis**: Identify business rules and validation needs
3. **Technical Constraints Analysis**: Assess technical limitations and system requirements
4. **Quality Standards Analysis**: Review quality requirements and non-functional needs

### Phase 2: Criteria Generation (4 Concurrent Streams)
5. **Functional Criteria Stream**: Generate primary functional acceptance criteria
6. **User Experience Criteria Stream**: Create user-focused experience and usability criteria
7. **Technical Validation Stream**: Develop technical validation and integration criteria
8. **Edge Case & Error Handling Stream**: Generate exception handling and boundary condition criteria

### Phase 3: Criteria Validation & Integration (3 Parallel Tasks)
9. **Testability Validation**: Ensure all criteria are testable and measurable
10. **Completeness Assessment**: Verify comprehensive coverage of story requirements
11. **Quality Integration**: Align criteria with Definition of Done and quality standards

## Expected Outcomes
