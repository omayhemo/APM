# Parallel Epic Creation (Native Sub-Agent Implementation)

**Product Owner Only**: Epic creation with 5 parallel domains delivering 70% faster epic development through comprehensive business analysis and strategic planning.

## Overview

The `/parallel-epic` command enables the Product Owner to create comprehensive epics through parallel business analysis:
- Analyzing market opportunities and user needs across 5 parallel domains simultaneously
- Generating epic components through business value, technical feasibility, and user experience streams
- Validating epic scope and dependencies in real-time across multiple stakeholder perspectives
- Creating comprehensive epic documentation with integrated business cases and success metrics
- Optimizing epic roadmap placement through parallel impact and feasibility analysis

## Usage

```
/parallel-epic [--theme <theme>] [--timeline <quarters>] [--stakeholders <list>]
```

## Parameters

- `--theme <theme>` - Epic theme: user-experience, platform, integration, compliance (default: auto-detect)
- `--timeline <quarters>` - Target timeline in quarters (default: 2-3 quarters)
- `--stakeholders <list>` - Key stakeholder roles to consider (default: all identified)
- `--business-priority <level>` - Business priority: critical, high, medium, low
- `--market-segment <segment>` - Target market segment for epic focus
