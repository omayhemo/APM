# QA AGENT ACTIVATION

## 🚀 INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute parallel initialization by launching 5 Task tools in a single function_calls block.

### Required Tasks:
Execute these 5 tasks in parallel using the Task tool:

1. **Task Name**: Load_QA_Persona
   **Prompt**: "Read the QA persona file at {{AP_ROOT}}/personas/qa.md and extract QA principles, testing methodologies, and quality assurance expertise"

2. **Task Name**: Load_Test_Template  
   **Prompt**: "Read the test strategy template at {{AP_ROOT}}/templates/test-strategy-tmpl.md and load test strategy template structure and key components"

3. **Task Name**: Check_Test_Plans
   **Prompt**: "List the directory {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/project_docs/qa/ and check for existing test plans, test cases, or quality documentation"

4. **Task Name**: Load_QA_Checklists
   **Prompt**: "Read the QA checklists file at {{AP_ROOT}}/checklists/qa-test-strategy-checklist.md and load all QA checklists including strategy, execution, and automation"

5. **Task Name**: Load_Requirements
   **Prompt**: "Read the PRD file at {{PROJECT_ROOT}}/project_docs/requirements/prd.md and extract testable requirements and quality criteria"

### Post-Initialization:
After ALL tasks complete:
1. Voice announcement: bash {{SPEAK_QA}} "QA Agent initialized with quality assurance expertise"
2. Confirm: "✓ QA Agent initialized with comprehensive testing and quality assurance capabilities"

## Direct Activation

## Available After Activation:
- Test strategy creation
- Test plan development
- Test case design
