## Technical Design

### Advanced Pattern Examples

#### 1. Dynamic Scaling Pattern
```markdown
# Intelligent agent scaling based on workload:

Analyzing sprint backlog...
- 12 stories identified
- Complexity: 3 simple, 6 medium, 3 complex
- Dependencies: 2 blocking chains

Optimal allocation:
- 2 agents for simple stories (parallel)
- 4 agents for medium stories (2 parallel sets)
- 2 agents for complex stories (with architect support)

Auto-scaling to 6 agents for optimal throughput...
```

#### 2. ML-Powered Synthesis
```markdown
# Advanced result synthesis with confidence scoring:

Collecting outputs from 6 agents...

ML Synthesis Results:
- High confidence consensus (95%): 
  "Authentication should use OAuth2 with JWT"
- Medium confidence (72%):
  "Consider microservices for scalability"
- Conflicts detected:
  "Database choice: PostgreSQL vs MongoDB"
  
Recommendation: Schedule architect review for conflicts
```

#### 3. Pipeline Orchestration
```markdown
# Multi-stage pipeline with conditional flow:

Pipeline: Feature Development Flow
Stage 1: Requirements Analysis (2 agents) ─┐
                                          ├─→ Gate: Clarity Check
Stage 2: Architecture Design (3 agents) ──┘          │
                                                    ↓ Pass
Stage 3: Parallel Implementation (4 agents) ────→ Integration
                                                      │
Stage 4: Testing & Validation (3 agents) ←───────────┘

Conditional: If integration fails, loop back with fixes
```

#### 4. Predictive Optimization
```markdown
# Learning from execution patterns:

Historical Analysis:
- /parallel-sprint typically needs 4.2 agents
- Peak load on Mondays (scale to 6)
- QA commands follow dev by ~2 hours

Predictive adjustments:
- Pre-warming 4 developer agents
- Scheduling QA agent pool for 2 hours later
- Resource reservation for peak times
```

### Implementation Examples

#### Dynamic Workload Distribution
```markdown
User: /parallel-sprint --auto-scale

🧠 Intelligent Sprint Orchestration
═══════════════════════════════════

Analyzing workload complexity...
Calculating optimal agent distribution...

Dynamic allocation:
- Simple stories (3) → 1 Developer agent (batch mode)
- API stories (4) → 2 Developer agents (specialized)
- Complex features (2) → 2 Dev + 1 Architect (collaborative)
- Integration (1) → 1 Dev + continuous QA monitoring

Execution plan optimized for:
- Minimum completion time: 1:45
- Resource efficiency: 78%
- Quality assurance: Continuous
```

#### Self-Healing Workflows
```markdown
# Automatic recovery from agent failures:

Agent 3 timeout detected...
Analyzing incomplete work...

Recovery actions:
1. Checkpoint state saved
2. Spawning replacement agent
3. Resuming from checkpoint
4. Adjusting timeout +30s
5. Continuing execution

No manual intervention required
Estimated delay: 2 minutes
```

## Success Metrics

- Dynamic scaling reduces execution time by additional 20%
- ML synthesis improves result quality by 15%
- Self-optimization reduces failures by 50%
- Workflow completion rate >99%
- User satisfaction with advanced features

## Risks and Mitigations
