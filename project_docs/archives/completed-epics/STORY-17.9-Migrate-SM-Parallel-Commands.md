# Story 17.9: Migrate SM Parallel Commands

**Story ID**: 17.9  
**Epic**: Epic 17 - Parallel Commands to Native Sub-Agents Migration  
**Sprint**: 19 - Core Migration Phase  
**Points**: 8  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Ready for Development  
**Dependencies**: Sprint 18 completion, Story 17.5

## Story Description

As a Scrum Master, I want my story creation and validation commands migrated to native sub-agents so that I can prepare sprint backlogs 65-75% faster while maintaining story quality.

## Business Value

Scrum Master parallel commands are essential for rapid story preparation and sprint planning. Native sub-agents will enable simultaneous story development, validation, and sprint adjustment activities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Command Migration ✓
**Given** the 4 SM parallel commands  
**When** migrating to native sub-agents  
**Then** successfully migrate:
- [ ] /parallel-next-story - Advanced story creation
- [ ] /parallel-stories - Batch story generation
- [ ] /parallel-checklist - Comprehensive validation
- [ ] /parallel-course-correction - Sprint adjustment

### 2. Story Creation Enhancement ✓
**Given** the need for rapid story development  
**When** using /parallel-next-story  
**Then** execute simultaneously:
- [ ] Story structure creation
- [ ] Acceptance criteria development
- [ ] Technical requirements analysis
- [ ] Dependency identification
- [ ] Validation against DoD

### 3. Batch Operations ✓
**Given** multiple stories needed  
**When** using /parallel-stories  
**Then** achieve:
- [ ] 5-10 stories created in parallel
- [ ] Consistent format and quality
- [ ] Dependencies mapped between stories
- [ ] Story points estimated
- [ ] 75% time reduction

### 4. Validation Efficiency ✓
**Given** stories requiring validation  
**When** using /parallel-checklist  
**Then** validate:
- [ ] INVEST criteria compliance
- [ ] Acceptance criteria completeness
- [ ] Technical feasibility
- [ ] Dependency accuracy
- [ ] Definition of Ready

### 5. Sprint Adjustment ✓
**Given** mid-sprint changes  
**When** using /parallel-course-correction  
**Then** analyze:
- [ ] Scope adjustment options
- [ ] Blocker resolution paths
- [ ] Priority realignment
- [ ] Capacity reallocation
- [ ] Risk mitigation strategies

## Technical Design

### Command Migration Patterns

#### /parallel-next-story
```markdown
# OLD Task-based:
Task("Create story structure", "Generate story format...")
Task("Write acceptance criteria", "Define success criteria...")
Task("Analyze technical needs", "Identify requirements...")

# NEW Native sub-agents:
"I need an SM agent to create story structure for Feature X
 Context: User authentication, 5 points, Sprint 19"

"I need another SM agent to develop acceptance criteria
 Context: Security requirements, user experience goals"

"I need a Developer agent to analyze technical requirements
 Context: Architecture constraints, API design needs"

"I need a QA agent to define test scenarios
 Context: Coverage requirements, edge cases"

"I need an SM agent to validate against Definition of Ready
 Context: Team standards, completeness checklist"
```

#### /parallel-stories
```markdown
# Batch story creation:
"I need SM agent 1 to create stories 1-3 for authentication
 Context: Login, registration, password reset flows"

"I need SM agent 2 to create stories 4-6 for user management
 Context: Profile, settings, preferences features"

"I need SM agent 3 to create stories 7-9 for API development
 Context: REST endpoints, authentication, data models"

"I need SM agent 4 to create integration stories
 Context: Frontend-backend, third-party services"
```

#### /parallel-checklist
```markdown
# Comprehensive validation:
"I need an SM agent to validate story completeness
 Context: All fields populated, clear descriptions"

"I need a PO agent to validate business value
 Context: User value, ROI, strategic alignment"

"I need an Architect agent to validate technical approach
 Context: Patterns, standards, best practices"

"I need a QA agent to validate testability
 Context: Clear criteria, measurable outcomes"
```

### Sprint Coordination Pattern
```markdown
# For course correction:
1. Spawn analyst agents for different perspectives
2. Each analyzes sprint from their viewpoint
3. Synthesize recommendations
4. Present options with trade-offs
5. Update sprint plan based on decision
```

### Example Execution
```markdown
User: /parallel-next-story

SM: Creating comprehensive story with parallel analysis...

📋 Parallel Story Development
═══════════════════════════════

Spawning specialized agents:
✓ SM Agent → Story structure and format
✓ SM Agent → Acceptance criteria development
✓ Developer → Technical requirements analysis
✓ QA Agent → Test scenario definition
✓ Validator → Definition of Ready check

Story Development Progress:
[SM1] Structure complete ██████████ 100%
[SM2] Criteria drafted █████████░ 90%
[Dev] Tech analysis ████████░░ 80%
[QA] Test scenarios ███████░░░ 70%
[Val] DoR validation █████████░ 90%

Story Created:
- Title: Implement OAuth2 Authentication
- Points: 5
- Acceptance Criteria: 6 items
- Technical Requirements: Documented
- Test Scenarios: 12 defined
- Time: 6 minutes (vs 25 minutes sequential)
- Quality Score: 98/100
```

## Implementation Approach

1. **Analyze SM Workflows** - Map current Task patterns
2. **Create Agent Specializations** - Templates for each role
3. **Implement Parallel Validation** - Multi-perspective checks
4. **Add Synthesis Logic** - Combine agent outputs
5. **Measure Time Savings** - Verify 65-75% improvement

## Success Metrics

- All 4 SM commands migrated
- 65-75% faster story creation
- Maintained story quality (>95%)
- Improved validation coverage
- Enhanced sprint agility

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Story quality variance | Medium | Strict templates |
| Validation gaps | Low | Multiple validators |
| Coordination overhead | Low | Clear boundaries |

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] 4 SM parallel commands migrated
- [ ] 65-75% performance improvement
- [ ] Story quality maintained
- [ ] Integration with backlog tools
- [ ] Documentation complete
