# Story 17.10: Migrate Remaining Persona Commands

**Story ID**: 17.10  
**Epic**: Epic 17 - Parallel Commands to Native Sub-Agents Migration  
**Sprint**: 20 - Complete Transition Phase  
**Points**: 8  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: Ready for Development  
**Dependencies**: Sprint 19 completion

## Story Description

As a developer, I want all remaining parallel commands (Analyst, PM, Developer) migrated to native sub-agents so that we achieve complete migration and consistent performance improvements across all personas.

## Business Value

Completing the migration of all parallel commands ensures consistent user experience, eliminates all Task-based execution, and delivers the full performance benefits of native sub-agents.

- [ ] Include all standard sections
- [ ] Enable collaborative input
- [ ] Generate consistent format

### 3. Developer Command Migration ‚úì

- [ ] Security pattern checking
- [ ] Performance analysis
- [ ] Best practice validation

### 4. Performance Consistency ‚úì
**Given** all migrated commands  
**When** measuring performance  
**Then** achieve:
- [ ] Minimum 4x improvement across all commands
- [ ] Consistent execution patterns
- [ ] No Task tool usage remaining
- [ ] Zero CLI crashes
- [ ] Predictable performance

### 5. Integration Completeness ‚úì
**Given** the full suite of parallel commands  
**When** all migrations complete  
**Then** ensure:
- [ ] All commands use native sub-agents
- [ ] Consistent context passing
- [ ] Unified progress monitoring
- [ ] Complete backward compatibility
- [ ] Comprehensive documentation

## Technical Design

### Analyst Command Patterns

#### /parallel-requirements
```markdown
# Requirements analysis with multiple perspectives:
"I need an Analyst agent to analyze functional requirements
 Context: User stories, acceptance criteria, business rules"

"I need another Analyst to analyze non-functional requirements
 Context: Performance, security, scalability, compliance"

"I need an Analyst to identify gaps and assumptions
 Context: Missing information, clarification needs"

"I need an Analyst to create requirements traceability
 Context: Story mapping, dependency tracking"
```

#### /parallel-brainstorming
```markdown
# Creative ideation with diverse agents:
"I need an Analyst to explore technical solutions
 Context: Problem space, constraints, existing patterns"

"I need a Creative agent to generate innovative approaches
 Context: User experience, market trends, competitive analysis"

"I need an Analyst to evaluate feasibility
 Context: Technical constraints, resource availability"
```

### PM Command Pattern

#### /parallel-prd
```markdown
# Comprehensive PRD creation:
"I need a PM agent to write the executive summary and goals
 Context: Business objectives, success metrics, timeline"

"I need another PM agent to detail user personas and journeys
 Context: User research, pain points, workflows"

"I need a PM agent to specify functional requirements
 Context: Features, user stories, acceptance criteria"

"I need a PM agent to define success metrics and KPIs
 Context: Business metrics, user metrics, technical metrics"

"I need an Architect agent to add technical requirements
 Context: Architecture, integrations, constraints"

"I need a QA agent to define quality requirements
 Context: Testing strategy, performance targets"
```

### Developer Command Pattern

#### /parallel-review
```markdown
# Comprehensive code review:
"I need a Developer agent to review code logic and structure
 Context: File: auth.js, Focus: algorithms, error handling"

"I need another Developer to check security patterns
 Context: Authentication, input validation, data protection"

"I need a Developer agent to analyze performance
 Context: Database queries, caching, optimization"

"I need a Developer to validate best practices
 Context: Code style, patterns, maintainability"
```

### Example Execution
```markdown
User: /parallel-prd

[QA] Quality reqs ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà 100%

PRD Generated:
- 12 sections completed
- 28 pages of comprehensive documentation
- Time: 35 minutes (vs 120 minutes sequential)
- Performance: 3.4x improvement
- Quality score: 96/100
```

## Implementation Approach

1. **Complete Command Inventory** - List all remaining parallel commands
2. **Create Persona Templates** - Natural language for each persona type
3. **Implement Consistent Patterns** - Use learnings from previous migrations
4. **Validate Performance** - Ensure 4x minimum improvement
5. **Remove Task Dependencies** - Eliminate all Task tool usage

## Success Metrics

- All remaining parallel commands migrated
- Consistent 4x+ performance improvement
- Zero Task tool usage in codebase
- Complete documentation coverage
- User satisfaction maintained

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Inconsistent patterns | Medium | Use established templates |
| Missing commands | Low | Comprehensive inventory |
| Performance variance | Low | Consistent implementation |

## Definition of Done

- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Analyst commands (4) migrated
- [ ] PM command (1) migrated
- [ ] Developer command (1) migrated
- [ ] Performance validated (4x+)
- [ ] Task tool completely removed
- [ ] Documentation updated
