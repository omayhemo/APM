# Story 17.7: Migrate PO Parallel Commands

**Story ID**: 17.7  
**Epic**: Epic 17 - Parallel Commands to Native Sub-Agents Migration  
**Sprint**: 19 - Core Migration Phase  
**Points**: 5  
**Priority**: High  
**Status**: ‚úÖ Done  
**Dependencies**: Sprint 18 completion

## Story Description

As a Product Owner, I want my parallel backlog management commands migrated to native sub-agents so that I can groom backlogs, create stories, and validate requirements 70% faster with true parallelism.

## Business Value

Product Owner parallel commands directly impact sprint planning efficiency. Native sub-agents will enable simultaneous story creation, acceptance criteria development, and prioritization activities.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Command Migration ‚úì
**Given** the 5 PO parallel commands  
**When** migrating to native sub-agents  
**Then** successfully migrate:
- [x] /parallel-epic - Epic decomposition and analysis
- [x] /parallel-stories - Bulk story creation
- [x] /parallel-acceptance-criteria - Criteria definition
- [x] /parallel-prioritization - Smart backlog ordering
- [x] /parallel-validation - Requirements validation

### 2. Backlog Operations ‚úì
**Given** backlog management needs  
**When** using parallel commands  
**Then** the system should:
- [x] Read and update backlog.md accurately
- [x] Maintain story relationships and dependencies
- [x] Preserve epic hierarchies
- [x] Calculate story points consistently
- [x] Update status in real-time

### 3. Story Creation Efficiency ‚úì
**Given** the need to create multiple stories  
**When** using /parallel-stories  
**Then** achieve:
- [x] 70% faster story creation
- [x] Consistent story format
- [x] Complete acceptance criteria
- [x] Proper DoD compliance
- [x] Technical details included

### 4. Validation and Quality ‚úì
**Given** created stories and epics  
**When** running validation  
**Then** ensure:
- [x] All stories meet INVEST criteria
- [x] Acceptance criteria are testable
- [x] Dependencies identified
- [x] Story points estimated
- [x] Technical feasibility confirmed

### 5. Integration with Grooming ‚úì
**Given** the /groom command workflow  
**When** using parallel commands  
**Then** maintain:
- [x] Compatibility with grooming process
- [x] Velocity calculations
- [x] Sprint capacity planning
- [x] Blocker identification
- [x] Ready state verification

## Technical Design

### Command Migration Patterns

#### /parallel-epic
```markdown
# OLD Task-based:
Task("Analyze epic scope", "Break down epic...")
Task("Identify themes", "Group related features...")
Task("Create stories", "Generate user stories...")

# NEW Native sub-agents:
"I need a Product Analyst agent to analyze Epic 17 scope
 Context: 89 story points, 4 sprints, native sub-agent migration"

"I need a PO agent to identify feature themes
 Context: Group by persona, technical complexity, dependencies"

"I need another PO agent to draft initial stories
 Context: 3-8 points each, INVEST criteria, clear acceptance criteria"
```

#### /parallel-stories
```markdown
# Bulk story creation:
"I need a PO agent to create stories for Developer persona migration
 Context: Stories 17.5-17.9, Sprint 19, follow template"

"I need another PO agent to create stories for QA persona migration
 Context: Preserve AI/ML capabilities, 4x performance target"

"I need a PO agent to create integration stories
 Context: Cross-persona coordination, dependency management"
```

#### /parallel-validation
```markdown
# Comprehensive validation:
"I need a PO agent to validate INVEST criteria for Sprint 19 stories
 Context: Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable"

"I need an Architect agent to validate technical feasibility
 Context: Native sub-agent capabilities, performance targets"

"I need a QA agent to validate testability
 Context: Acceptance criteria clarity, test scenarios"
```

### Example Execution
```markdown
User: /parallel-stories sprint=19

PO: Creating stories for Sprint 19 in parallel...

üìù Parallel Story Creation
‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê‚ïê

Spawning specialized PO agents:
‚úì PO Agent 1 ‚Üí Creating SM command migration stories
‚úì PO Agent 2 ‚Üí Creating Architect command stories
‚úì PO Agent 3 ‚Üí Creating cross-persona integration stories
‚úì PO Agent 4 ‚Üí Updating acceptance criteria

Story Creation Progress:
[PO 1] Story 17.8 draft complete ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë 80%
[PO 2] Story 17.9 in progress ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 60%
[PO 3] Integration stories ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë‚ñë‚ñë 70%
[PO 4] Criteria validation ‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñà‚ñë 90%

Results:
- 5 stories created in 8 minutes
- All INVEST criteria met
- Acceptance criteria complete
- Dependencies mapped
- Performance: 75% faster than sequential
```

### Backlog Update Pattern
```markdown
# Automatic backlog.md updates:
1. PO agents work on story creation
2. Each agent updates their section
3. Orchestrator merges updates
4. Conflicts resolved automatically
5. Final backlog.md updated atomically
```

## Implementation Approach

1. **Analyze Current Implementation** - Map Task patterns in PO commands
2. **Create PO Agent Templates** - Natural language for each operation
3. **Implement Backlog Safety** - Ensure atomic updates
4. **Add Validation Logic** - Maintain quality standards
5. **Measure Efficiency** - Confirm 70% improvement

## Success Metrics

- All 5 PO commands migrated
- 70% faster backlog operations
- Zero data corruption in backlog.md
- Maintained story quality
- Improved parallel grooming

## Risks and Mitigations

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Backlog conflicts | High | Atomic update mechanism |
| Story quality degradation | Medium | Validation agents |
| Dependency confusion | Low | Clear context passing |

## Definition of Done

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] All 5 PO parallel commands migrated
- [x] Backlog operations 70% faster
- [x] Story quality maintained
- [x] Integration with grooming verified
- [x] Documentation complete
