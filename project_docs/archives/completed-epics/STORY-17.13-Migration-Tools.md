# Story 17.13: Migration Tools

**Story ID**: 17.13  
**Epic**: Epic 17 - Parallel Commands to Native Sub-Agents Migration  
**Sprint**: 20 - Complete Transition Phase  
**Points**: 3  
**Priority**: Medium  
**Status**: Ready for Development  
**Dependencies**: Stories 17.1-17.12

## Story Description

As a user migrating to native sub-agents, I want tools to help me transition smoothly, validate my migration, and compare performance between old and new systems.

## Business Value

Migration tools reduce friction in adoption, help users validate the benefits, and provide confidence in the new system through clear comparisons and health checks.

## Acceptance Criteria

### 1. Command Converter ✓
**Given** existing workflows using Task-based commands  
**When** users want to migrate  
**Then** provide:
- [ ] Command syntax converter utility
- [ ] Parameter mapping guide
- [ ] Automated script updates
- [ ] Validation of converted commands
- [ ] Rollback instructions

### 2. Migration Validator ✓
**Given** migrated commands  
**When** validating correctness  
**Then** check:
- [ ] Output consistency between modes
- [ ] Performance improvement achieved
- [ ] No functional regression
- [ ] Resource usage acceptable
- [ ] Error handling preserved

### 3. Performance Comparison Tool ✓
**Given** the need to demonstrate value  
**When** comparing execution modes  
**Then** show:
- [ ] Side-by-side execution times
- [ ] Resource usage comparison
- [ ] Quality metrics comparison
- [ ] Visual performance graphs
- [ ] Detailed analysis reports

### 4. Health Check Utilities ✓
**Given** production deployment  
**When** monitoring system health  
**Then** provide:
- [ ] Native sub-agent availability check
- [ ] Performance baseline validation
- [ ] Resource utilization monitoring
- [ ] Error rate tracking
- [ ] Automatic issue detection

### 5. Rollback Procedures ✓
**Given** potential issues  
**When** rollback needed  
**Then** enable:
- [ ] One-command rollback to Task mode
- [ ] Gradual rollback per command
- [ ] State preservation during rollback
- [ ] Clear rollback documentation
- [ ] Recovery verification

## Technical Design

### Tool Suite Components

#### 1. Command Converter
```bash
# Convert command syntax
./migrate-command convert "/parallel-sprint --old-param"
Output: "Command updated for native agents: /parallel-sprint"

# Batch conversion
./migrate-command convert-all --input=scripts/ --output=scripts-migrated/
Converted 15 scripts successfully
```

#### 2. Migration Validator
```bash
# Validate single command
./migrate-command validate /parallel-qa-framework

Validation Results:
✓ Functional correctness: PASS
✓ Performance improvement: 4.3x
✓ Resource usage: Optimal
✓ Error handling: Preserved
✓ Output format: Consistent

Overall: READY FOR PRODUCTION
```

#### 3. Performance Comparison
```bash
# Compare execution modes
./migrate-command compare /parallel-sprint

Performance Comparison: /parallel-sprint
════════════════════════════════════════

Execution Mode    Time      Memory    CPU     Result
─────────────────────────────────────────────────
Task-based        10:32     1.2GB     45%     ✓
Native Agents     2:18      0.8GB     62%     ✓

Improvement:      4.6x      33% less  --      Same

Recommendation: Use native agents for 4.6x speedup
```

#### 4. Health Check Dashboard
```markdown
📊 Native Sub-Agent Health Check
════════════════════════════════

System Status: ✓ HEALTHY

Availability:
- Sub-agent spawning: ✓ Operational
- All personas available: ✓ 9/9
- Response time: ✓ 0.7s average

Performance:
- Current throughput: 4.8x baseline
- Resource usage: 67% capacity
- Error rate: 0.01%

Recent Issues: None in last 24 hours
```

#### 5. Rollback Script
```bash
# Immediate rollback
./migrate-command rollback --all
Rolling back to Task-based execution...
✓ Configuration updated
✓ Backward compatibility activated
✓ All commands using Task mode

# Selective rollback
./migrate-command rollback --command=/parallel-sprint
✓ /parallel-sprint reverted to Task mode
Note: Other commands still using native agents
```

### Integration Pattern
```markdown
# In user's workflow:
1. Run health check before migration
2. Use converter for script updates
3. Validate each migrated command
4. Compare performance metrics
5. Monitor health post-migration
6. Rollback if issues detected
```

## Implementation Examples

### Migration Workflow Tool
```bash
./migrate-command wizard

🚀 Native Sub-Agent Migration Wizard
═══════════════════════════════════

Step 1: Analyzing your usage...
Found 12 parallel commands in use

Step 2: Testing compatibility...
✓ All commands compatible

Step 3: Performance preview...
Expected improvement: 4.2x - 6.8x

Step 4: Migration plan...
- Phase 1: Low-risk commands (8)
- Phase 2: Critical commands (4)

Ready to proceed? (y/n): y

Migrating...
[████████████████████] 100% Complete
