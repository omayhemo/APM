## ‚úÖ Validation Checklist

### Post-Migration Validation

```bash
# 1. Verify Installation
cat .apm/VERSION                    # Should show 4.3.0
/coherence                         # Should activate successfully

# 2. Test New Commands
/planning-business-case            # Should launch with 18 parallel sub-agents
/designer                         # Should launch design persona

# 3. Test Migrated Workflows
/po                               # Should include sprint planning capabilities
/planning-groom                   # Should provide AI-powered grooming

# 4. Verify Performance
time /planning-business-case      # Should complete in ~45 seconds

# 5. Check Documentation
ls .claude/commands/ | wc -l     # Should show 70+ commands
grep -r "sm" .claude/commands/   # Should return minimal results
grep -r "designer" .claude/commands/ | head -3  # Should show designer command
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: `/sm` command not found**
```bash
# Solution: Use replacement commands
/po                    # For most SM functionality
/planning-business-case # For comprehensive planning
/coherence             # For team coordination
```

**Issue: `design-architect` references not working**
```bash
# Solution: Update to new naming
/designer              # New command name
# Update any custom scripts with old references
```

**Issue: Performance not improved**
```bash
# Solution: Verify v4.3.0 installation
/coherence | head -5   # Should mention v4.3.0 and native sub-agents
# If not, reinstall v4.3.0
```
