# APM Framework v4.3.0 - Breaking Changes & API Updates

## 🚨 Critical Breaking Changes

### 1. Scrum Master (SM) Persona Removal

**Breaking Change**: The SM persona has been completely removed in v4.3.0

**Impact**:
- `/sm` command no longer available
- `speakSm.sh` voice script removed
- All SM-specific templates and configurations removed

**Migration Path**:
```bash
# v4.2.0 (DEPRECATED)
/sm "Create user stories for feature X"

# v4.3.0 (CURRENT)
/po "Create user stories for feature X"  # Use Product Owner instead
/pm "Create epic for feature X"          # Or Product Manager for high-level planning
```

**Affected Areas**:
- Command activation: `/sm` → 404 error
- Voice notifications: `speakSm.sh` → file not found
- Template references: SM templates → removed
- Documentation: SM references → deprecated notices

### 2. Designer Persona Rename

**Breaking Change**: `design-architect` renamed to `designer`

**Impact**:
- `/design-architect` command deprecated (still works but shows warning)
- All references updated to use `designer` terminology
- Voice script remains `speakDesigner.sh` (unchanged)

**Migration Path**:
```bash
# v4.2.0 (DEPRECATED - still works with warning)
/design-architect "Create UI mockups"

# v4.3.0 (RECOMMENDED)
/designer "Create UI mockups"
```

**Backward Compatibility**: 
- ✅ `/design-architect` still works but shows deprecation warning
- ⚠️ Warning: Support will be removed in v4.4.0

## 🔧 Migration Guide

### Automated Migration

For automated migration of existing scripts and configurations:

```bash
# Replace all SM references with PO
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's|/sm |/po |g' {} \;
find . -name "*.sh" -exec sed -i 's|speakSm.sh|speakPo.sh|g' {} \;

# Update design-architect references
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's|/design-architect|/designer|g' {} \;
find . -name "*.md" -exec sed -i 's|design-architect|designer|g' {} \;
```

### Manual Migration Steps

1. **Update Command Scripts**:
   - Replace `/sm` calls with `/po` or `/pm`
   - Update `/design-architect` to `/designer`
   - Remove any hardcoded `speakSm.sh` references

2. **Update Documentation**:
   - Update persona counts from 9 to 8
   - Remove SM persona descriptions
   - Update designer persona terminology

3. **Update Automation/CI**:
   - Remove SM-related test cases
   - Update persona enumeration code
   - Update voice notification chains

## 🚨 Error Handling

### Expected Errors After Upgrade

**SM Command Error**:
```bash
$ /sm "Create stories"
Error: Command '/sm' not found. Use '/po' or '/pm' instead.
Migration: Scrum Master functionality merged into Product Owner.
```

**Voice Script Error**:
```bash
$ bash speakSm.sh "Message"
bash: speakSm.sh: No such file or directory
Migration: Use speakPo.sh instead
```

### Graceful Error Recovery

The framework includes automatic error recovery:
- `/sm` commands show helpful migration messages
- `speakSm.sh` calls are automatically redirected to `speakPo.sh` where possible
- Deprecated warnings for `/design-architect` include migration suggestions
