# Parallel Commands API Reference - v4.3.2

## Overview

APM v4.3.2 builds upon the revolutionary native Claude Code sub-agent architecture for all 45+ parallel commands, delivering enhanced performance with the new 5-agent `/version` command architecture and streamlined 8-persona system.

## Core Commands

### üöÄ /parallel-sprint

Coordinates multiple Developer agents for parallel story implementation.

**Syntax**: `/parallel-sprint [options]`

**Native Agent Activation**:
Spawns 2-4 Developer agents based on sprint capacity:
- "I need a Developer agent to work on Story X..."
- "I need another Developer agent for Story Y..."
- "I need a QA agent to coordinate testing..."
- "I need an Architect agent to review integration..."

**Options**:
- `--max-agents=N`: Limit concurrent agents (default: 4)
- `--timeout=S`: Set timeout in seconds (default: 300)
- `--mode=native|task`: Force execution mode (default: native)

**Performance**:
- Execution time: 2-3 minutes (vs 10-12 minutes sequential)
- Performance gain: 4-6x
- Resource usage: Moderate (4 agents √ó 200k tokens)

**Example**:
```bash
$ /parallel-sprint
üöÄ Launching 4 Developer agents for Sprint 18...

## QA Commands (AI/ML Enhanced)

### ü§ñ /qa-predict

ML-powered test failure prediction (92% accuracy).

### ‚ö° /qa-optimize  

Test execution optimization (63% time reduction).

### üîç /qa-anomaly

Quality anomaly detection (94% precision).

## Enhanced Commands in v4.3.2

### üì¶ /version (Enhanced 5-Agent Architecture)

Comprehensive documentation update with enhanced payload processing.

**Syntax**: `/version <version> [--beta|--rc|--alpha] [--dry-run]`

**Native Agent Architecture (NEW)**:
```
Phase 2: Version Updates (5 Parallel Sub-Agents)
- SubAgent1: Core Version Files  
- SubAgent2: Payload Directory (CRITICAL - Distribution Package) [NEW]
- SubAgent3: Documentation Headers
- SubAgent4: Installation Commands
- SubAgent5: Configuration Files
```

**Key Enhancement**:
- **NEW SubAgent2**: Dedicated payload directory processing ensures distribution package integrity
- **Improved Coverage**: All distribution files now receive consistent version updates
- **Better Reliability**: Enhanced error handling for critical distribution components

**Performance**:
- **Execution time**: Maintained at 8-12 minutes with improved coverage
- **Distribution integrity**: 100% version consistency across payload directory
- **Quality assurance**: Enhanced validation for release readiness

## Context Passing

All native sub-agents receive optimized context:
- **Size limit**: <20,000 tokens (10% of available window)
- **Processing overhead**: <5 seconds  
- **Cache efficiency**: 60-80% hit rate
- **Format**: Natural language with structured data

## Result Aggregation

Native agents return results in unified formats:
- **Hierarchical synthesis**: Organized by domain/priority
- **Workflow-based**: Sequential presentation of related outputs
- **Risk-based**: Critical items first, supporting details follow

## Performance Characteristics

| Command Category | Improvement | Agents | Context per Agent |
|------------------|-------------|--------|-------------------|
| Sprint Coordination | 4-6x | 2-4 | 200k tokens |
| QA Framework | 4-7x | 4-6 | 200k tokens |
| Architecture | 3-5x | 5-6 | 200k tokens |
| Story Management | 3-4x | 5-7 | 200k tokens |

## Natural Language Patterns

### Basic Agent Spawning
```
I need a [PERSONA] agent to [TASK]
Context: [SPECIFIC_CONTEXT]
Focus: [KEY_REQUIREMENTS]
```

### Parallel Coordination
```
I need multiple agents working simultaneously:
1. [PERSONA] agent: [TASK_1]
2. [PERSONA] agent: [TASK_2]  
3. [PERSONA] agent: [TASK_3]
All agents should coordinate on [INTEGRATION_POINTS]
```

### Specialized Expertise
```
I need a [PERSONA] agent specialized in [DOMAIN] to [SPECIFIC_TASK]
Requirements: [DETAILED_SPECS]
Success criteria: [MEASURABLE_OUTCOMES]
Dependencies: [RELATED_WORK]
```

## Error Handling

Native sub-agents provide graceful error handling:
- Individual agent failures don't stop other agents
- Partial results are preserved and presented
- Automatic retry for transient failures
- Clear error messages with resolution suggestions

## Native Sub-Agent Architecture

### Performance Optimized
1. All commands use native Claude Code sub-agents
2. Automatic intelligent agent coordination
3. 4-8x performance improvement achieved

### Architecture Benefits
| Feature | Native Sub-Agents | Benefit |
|---------|-------------------|---------|
| Parallel execution | True concurrent processing | 4-8x faster execution |
| Agent coordination | Automatic intelligent spawning | Simplified usage |
| CLI stability | Zero crashes with native integration | Rock-solid reliability |
