# APM Framework v4.3.2 - Frequently Asked Questions

## üÜï v4.3.2 Persona and Command Updates

### Q: Why was the SM (Scrum Master) persona removed in v4.3.2?
**A: Streamlined for better clarity and reduced complexity:**

The SM persona was removed to simplify the framework and eliminate overlap:
- **Sprint Planning**: Now handled by `/po` (Product Owner) with enhanced capabilities
- **Backlog Grooming**: Use `/planning-groom` with 18 parallel sub-agents for superior results
- **Team Coordination**: `/coherence` orchestrator provides better coordination
- **Project Management**: `/pm` handles strategic planning and stakeholder management

**Migration Path:**
- Replace `/sm` with `/po` for most use cases
- Use `/planning-business-case` for comprehensive analysis
- Use `/coherence` for orchestrated team coordination

### Q: What's the difference between design-architect and designer?
**A: Same functionality, clearer naming:**

- **v4.2.0 and earlier**: `/design-architect` command
- **v4.3.2**: `/designer` command (design-architect deprecated)
- **Functionality**: Identical capabilities - UI/UX design, design systems, frontend architecture
- **Migration**: Simply replace `design-architect` with `designer` in your workflows

### Q: What's new about the `/planning-business-case` command?
**A: Revolutionary business analysis with 18 parallel sub-agents:**

- **18 Parallel Streams**: Simultaneous analysis across all business dimensions
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Domain analysis, story generation, optimization planning
- **45-Second Execution**: Complete business case analysis in under a minute

cat .apm/VERSION  # Should show 4.3.2
/coherence --version  # Should also show 4.3.2

# Verify installation completeness
ls -la .apm/  # Should show complete framework structure
ls -la .claude/commands/  # Should show all available commands

# Test basic functionality
/coherence  # Should activate without errors and show v4.3.2
```

**Success Indicators:**

1. **Verify Installation**: Check if command exists in `.claude/commands/`
2. **Git Status**: Ensure working directory is clean
3. **Permissions**: Verify write access to all documentation files
4. **Version Format**: Use semantic versioning (e.g., 4.1.0, not v4.1.0)

### Q: GitHub integration failed. How do I fix it?
**A: GitHub integration troubleshooting:**

1. **GitHub CLI**: Install `gh` CLI if not available
2. **Authentication**: Run `gh auth login` to authenticate
3. **Repository Access**: Verify push permissions to repository
4. **Manual Fallback**: Use `/version` then manual GitHub release

### Q: Can I see what will change before running `/version`?
**A: Yes, use dry-run mode:**

```bash
/version 4.1.0 --dry-run
```

This shows:
- All files that will be updated
- Version changes that will be made
- Documentation that will be generated
- No actual changes are applied
