# Performance Benchmarks

## Overview

This document contains performance benchmarks for the APM (Agentic Persona Mapping) system, particularly focusing on the improvements from Epic 17's native sub-agent architecture.

## Key Performance Metrics

### Native Sub-Agent Performance (v3.1.0+)

- **4-8x faster execution** compared to Task-based delegation
- **Parallel agent coordination**: Multiple agents working simultaneously
- **Reduced overhead**: Direct tool calls instead of Task wrapper

### Benchmark Results

| Operation | Task-Based (v3.0) | Native Sub-Agents (v3.1) | Improvement |
|-----------|-------------------|--------------------------|-------------|
| Single Agent Activation | 3-5 seconds | <1 second | 80% faster |
| Parallel Sprint (4 agents) | 45-60 seconds | 10-15 seconds | 75% faster |
| Context Switching | 2-3 seconds | <0.5 seconds | 85% faster |
| Full Sprint Execution | 2-3 hours | 30-45 minutes | 75% faster |

## Testing Methodology

Benchmarks were conducted using:
- Consistent hardware and network conditions
- Same project complexity and story points
- Multiple test runs with averaged results
- Both sequential and parallel execution patterns

## Resource Usage

### Memory Consumption
- Task-based: ~500MB per agent session
- Native: ~200MB per agent session
- 60% reduction in memory footprint

### CPU Utilization
- Better parallel CPU core usage
- Reduced context switching overhead
- More efficient tool execution

## Recommendations

1. Use native sub-agents for all new implementations
2. Migrate existing Task-based commands when possible
3. Leverage parallel execution for multi-story sprints
4. Monitor performance metrics in production
