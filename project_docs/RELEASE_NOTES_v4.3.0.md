## ⚠️ Breaking Changes

### 🎭 **Persona Architecture Changes**
1. **SM (Scrum Master) Persona Removal**
   - **Impact**: The `/sm` command is no longer available
   - **Migration Required**: Users must transition to `/po` (Product Owner) or `/pm` (Product Manager)
   - **Timeline**: Immediate - no backward compatibility maintained

2. **Design Architect → Designer Transition**
   - **Impact**: `/design-architect` command deprecated (still works but shows warning)
   - **Migration Required**: Update all scripts and workflows to use `/designer`
   - **Timeline**: 6 months grace period before complete removal

### 🧹 **Command Cleanup**
- **Removed Legacy Commands**: `ux-spec`, `validation`, `wrap` completely removed
- **Enhanced Command Validation**: Stricter command validation with better error messages

## 🔄 Migration Guide

### 📋 **SM Persona Migration**
**For Scrum Master users**, transition to appropriate alternative personas:

```bash
# OLD: SM sprint coordination
/sm
/parallel-sprint
/parallel-checklist

# NEW: Use Product Owner for backlog management
/po
/parallel-stories
/planning-business-case

# NEW: Use Product Manager for strategic planning  
/pm
/parallel-prd
/parallel-requirements
```

**Sprint Management Migration**:
- Sprint planning → Use `/po` with `/parallel-stories`
- Sprint review → Use `/qa` with comprehensive testing commands
- Sprint retrospective → Use `/pm` with strategic analysis commands

### 🎨 **Design Architect → Designer Migration**
```bash
# OLD: Design architecture commands
/design-architect
/parallel-frontend-architecture
/design-system-creation

# NEW: Designer commands (enhanced UX focus)
/designer  
/parallel-design-system
/ux-workflow-optimization
```

**Update Required**:
1. Replace all `/design-architect` references in scripts with `/designer`
2. Update documentation to use designer terminology
3. Review workflow automation to use new command structure

### 📁 **Configuration Updates**
**No configuration file changes required** - all migrations are handled automatically by the framework.
