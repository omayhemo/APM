- âœ… Backlog integration

## ðŸ”§ Technical Implementation Notes

### What Changes:
1. **Storage**: `.apm/` â†’ `.claude/agents/`
2. **Invocation**: `/ap` commands â†’ "Hey [agent]"
3. **Context**: Shared â†’ Dedicated windows per agent
4. **Voice**: Mandatory â†’ Optional/Configurable

### What Stays the Same:
1. **Personas**: All behavioral patterns preserved
2. **Capabilities**: Zero feature regression
3. **Workflows**: Existing patterns continue
4. **Integration**: All tools and frameworks maintained

## ðŸ“ˆ Benefits for Users

1. **Immediate Relief**: TTS notifications become optional
2. **Better Performance**: Native integration reduces overhead
3. **Enhanced Context**: Each agent has dedicated workspace
4. **Smoother Experience**: No more command memorization
5. **Flexibility**: Use old commands or new mentions

## ðŸš€ Recommended Backlog Structure

### Epic: APM to Sub-Agents Migration (47 Story Points)

**Business Value**: Addresses user frustration, improves performance, maintains all capabilities

#### Sprint Planning Recommendation:
- **Sprint 14**: Phase 1 Foundation (13 points)
- **Sprint 15**: Phase 2 Enhancement (13 points)
- **Sprint 16**: Phase 3 Advanced Features (13 points)
- **Sprint 17**: Phase 4 Transition (8 points)

### Success Metrics:
- User satisfaction improvement (TTS issue resolved)
- Zero feature regression
- Performance improvement >20%
- Adoption rate >80% within 2 weeks
- Support tickets reduced by 50%

## ðŸ”´ Critical Decisions Needed from PO

1. **Priority Confirmation**: Is this migration top priority given user frustration?
2. **Sprint Allocation**: Approve 4-sprint timeline?
3. **Feature Freeze**: Pause other enhancements during migration?
4. **User Communication**: How to message this change?
5. **Rollback Strategy**: Dual-mode sufficient or need more?

## ðŸ“‹ Immediate Actions for PO

1. **Review** this transition document thoroughly
2. **Create** Epic 15: APM to Sub-Agents Migration
3. **Break down** into 12-15 detailed stories
4. **Prioritize** Phase 1 stories for Sprint 14
5. **Communicate** plan to address user frustration
6. **Update** backlog.md with new epic and stories
7. **Schedule** stakeholder alignment on migration

## Risk Mitigation

### High Priority Risks:
1. **User Adoption**: Mitigated by dual-mode operation
2. **Feature Loss**: Mitigated by comprehensive testing
3. **Performance**: Mitigated by phased rollout
4. **Complexity**: Mitigated by preserving all personas

### Contingency Plans:
- Maintain APM command system indefinitely if needed
- Gradual opt-in rather than forced migration
- Enhanced testing for each phase before proceeding

## Summary for PO Decision Making

The user's frustration with TTS notifications has created an urgent need for evolution. This migration plan offers a path to:

1. **Solve the immediate problem** (optional TTS)
2. **Preserve all investment** in APM personas
3. **Improve overall experience** with native integration
4. **Maintain backward compatibility** for risk mitigation

The 4-week timeline is aggressive but achievable with proper story breakdown and sprint planning. All existing capabilities are preserved while gaining the benefits of native Claude Code integration.

**Recommendation**: Proceed with Phase 1 immediately to demonstrate progress on user concerns while maintaining the sophisticated APM framework that has been built.
