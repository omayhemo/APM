## 2. Key Decisions Made

### Strategic Decisions

#### Epic 16 Scope and Approach
- **Decision**: 4-phase migration approach vs. big-bang conversion
- **Rationale**: Reduces risk, allows for user feedback, maintains stability
- **Impact**: 89 story points across 4 sprints, manageable complexity

#### APM Capability Preservation
- **Decision**: Zero feature regression requirement
- **Rationale**: User trust depends on maintaining existing functionality
- **Impact**: All 8 personas must migrate with identical capabilities

#### TTS Integration Priority
- **Decision**: Voice notifications addressed in Phase 2 (Story 16.12)
- **Rationale**: Core infrastructure first, then user experience enhancements
- **Impact**: Addresses reported TTS reliability issues systematically

#### Dual-Mode Operation
- **Decision**: Maintain backward compatibility during transition
- **Rationale**: Allows gradual user adoption, reduces resistance
- **Impact**: Added complexity but improved user experience

### Organizational Decisions

#### Archive Strategy
- **Decision**: Move all completed epics (1-15) to archive
- **Rationale**: Clean focus on current work, reduced cognitive load
- **Impact**: Cleaner backlog, easier sprint planning

#### Story Point Distribution
- **Decision**: Phase 1 = 21 points (manageable Sprint 14)
- **Rationale**: Conservative start allows for learning and adjustment
- **Impact**: Realistic sprint capacity, higher success probability

## 4. Next Steps

### Immediate Actions (Next Session)

#### For Scrum Master
1. **Sprint 14 Planning**: 
   - Review Phase 1 stories (16.1-16.5)
   - Assign stories to development team
   - Confirm 21-point capacity realistic
   - Schedule sprint ceremonies

2. **Team Preparation**:
   - Brief team on APM migration goals
   - Ensure understanding of sub-agent architecture
   - Confirm technical approach alignment

3. **Risk Monitoring**:
   - Track story progress against estimates
   - Monitor for scope creep or technical challenges
   - Prepare mitigation strategies

#### For Development Team
1. **Technical Preparation**:
   - Review sub-agent infrastructure requirements (Story 16.1)
   - Understand current APM architecture
   - Plan testing approach for persona migrations

2. **Story Execution Order**:
   - Start with 16.1 (Infrastructure) - blocks all others
   - Parallel execution of 16.2-16.4 (core agents)
   - Complete with 16.5 (Orchestrator)

### Medium-term Planning

#### Sprint 15 Preparation
- **Challenge**: 34 story points may require splitting
- **Action**: Monitor Sprint 14 velocity for capacity adjustment
- **Timeline**: Begin planning during Sprint 14 execution

#### Release Planning
