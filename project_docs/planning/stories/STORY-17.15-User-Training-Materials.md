### Interactive Example Format
```markdown
🎯 Interactive Tutorial: Your First Parallel Sprint

Step 1: Understanding the Command
Before: /parallel-sprint used Task simulation
Now: Real parallel execution with native agents!

Try it yourself:
$ /parallel-sprint

What you'll see:
- 4 Developer agents working simultaneously
- Real-time progress updates
- 4-6x faster completion

Step 2: Monitoring Progress
Watch as agents work in parallel...

🎉 Congratulations! You've run your first native parallel command!
```

### Quick Reference Card
```markdown
🚀 Native Sub-Agent Quick Reference
═══════════════════════════════════

Essential Commands:
├─ /parallel-sprint → Launch parallel development
├─ /parallel-qa-framework → Comprehensive testing
├─ /parallel-architecture → System design
└─ /migrate-command → Migration tools

Performance Tips:
✓ Pre-warm common agents
✓ Minimize context size
✓ Use batch operations
✓ Monitor resource usage

Common Issues:
❌ CLI crash → Update Claude Code
❌ Slow spawn → Check resources
❌ No improvement → Verify native mode

Need help? Run: /migrate-command help
```

### Video Script Example
```markdown
Title: "Getting Started with Native Sub-Agents"

[0:00] Introduction
"Welcome! Today you'll learn how native sub-agents 
deliver 4-8x performance improvements..."

[1:00] What's Changed
"Previously, parallel commands used Task simulation.
Now, you get TRUE parallel execution..."

[3:00] Your First Command
"Let's run /parallel-sprint and see the difference..."
[Demo showing side-by-side comparison]

[6:00] Understanding the Output
"Notice how 4 agents work simultaneously..."

[8:00] Next Steps
"Try these commands next..."

## Implementation Examples

### Interactive Playground
```markdown
🎮 APM Command Playground
════════════════════════

Select a command to try:
1. /parallel-sprint (Most popular!)
2. /parallel-qa-framework
3. /parallel-architecture
4. Custom command...

You selected: /parallel-sprint

Configure your test:
- Number of stories: [4]
- Complexity: [Medium]
- Include QA: [Yes]

[Run Simulation] [See Real Example]

Results would show:
- Execution time: 2:15
- Agents used: 4
- Performance gain: 4.5x
```

### FAQ Example Entries
```markdown
Q: Will my existing scripts break?
A: No! Backward compatibility ensures existing scripts continue working. The system automatically uses the best execution mode.

Q: How much faster is it really?
A: Most users see 4-6x improvement. Some commands like /parallel-qa achieve up to 7x speedup.

Q: What if I need different performance settings?
A: Native sub-agents automatically optimize for your system. Use performance monitoring commands to fine-tune execution.
