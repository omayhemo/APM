# Sprint 2 Developer Assignments

**Sprint**: 2  
**Duration**: Days 3-4 (1.2 days with parallel execution)  
**Total Points**: 13  
**Scrum Master Command**: `/parallel-sprint --sprint 2 --developers 3`

## Developer Assignments

### Developer 1: Classification Specialist
**Story**: 2.1 - Section Classification System (5 points)
**Focus Areas**:
- Design classification rule engine
- Implement section type detection
- Create classification metadata structure
- Handle edge cases (malformed sections)

**Success Criteria**:
- [x] Classify sections as standard/custom/new/deprecated
- [x] Generate confidence scores for classifications
- [x] Handle nested and complex sections
- [x] Process within 100ms per file
- [x] 95%+ classification accuracy

**Technical Approach**:
- Pattern matching for standard sections
- Heuristic analysis for custom sections
- Machine learning preparation for future enhancement

### Developer 2: Variable Processing Expert  
**Story**: 2.2 - Variable Substitution Engine (3 points)
**Focus Areas**:
- Variable detection patterns
- Substitution logic implementation
- Context preservation during substitution
- Template variable management

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Detect all {{variable}} patterns
- [ ] Support nested variable structures
- [ ] Preserve variable context and formatting
- [ ] Handle undefined variables gracefully
- [ ] Maintain variable->value mapping

**Technical Approach**:
- Regex-based pattern detection
- AST-like structure for nested variables
- Substitution with rollback capability

### Developer 3: Integration & Merge Specialist
**Story**: 2.3 - Basic Merge Engine (5 points)  
**Dependencies**: Integrates outputs from Dev 1 & Dev 2
**Focus Areas**:
- Core merge algorithm design
- Integration of classification results
- Application of variable substitutions
- Merge strategy implementation

**Success Criteria**:
- [ ] Merge sections based on classification
- [ ] Apply variable substitutions correctly
- [ ] Preserve user customizations
- [ ] Generate merge report
- [ ] Handle conflicts gracefully

**Technical Approach**:
- Wait for Dev 1 & 2 interfaces (Day 3.5)
- Implement with mock data initially
- Integrate real components (Day 3.8)
- End-to-end testing (Day 4.0)

## Coordination Timeline

### Day 3.0 - Sprint Start
- Scrum Master executes `/parallel-sprint`
- All developers begin work simultaneously
- Dev 3 starts with interface design

### Day 3.5 - Mid-Sprint Check
- Dev 1 & 2 share interfaces
- Dev 3 begins integration preparation
- Quick sync meeting (15 min)

### Day 3.8 - Integration Point
- Dev 1 completes classification
- Dev 2 completes substitution
- Dev 3 integrates components
- Testing begins

### Day 4.2 - Sprint Complete
- All stories integrated and tested
- Sprint review and demo
- Handoff to Sprint 3 team

## Communication Protocol

### Daily Standups
- 9:00 AM - Quick sync (10 min)
- Focus on dependencies and blockers
- Coordinate integration timing

### Integration Meetings
- Day 3.5 - Interface alignment
- Day 3.8 - Component integration
- Ad-hoc as needed

### Tools & Channels
- Git feature branches per story
- Slack channel: #sprint-2-merge-core
- Integration branch: `sprint-2-integration`

## Risk Management

### Risk 1: Integration Delays
**Mitigation**: Dev 3 works with mocks until components ready

### Risk 2: Classification Performance  
**Mitigation**: Dev 1 focuses on performance from start

### Risk 3: Variable Edge Cases
**Mitigation**: Dev 2 creates comprehensive test suite

## Definition of Done

### Story Level
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Unit tests written (>90% coverage)
- [ ] Integration tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed by peer
- [ ] Documentation updated

### Sprint Level
- [ ] All stories integrated
- [ ] End-to-end tests passing
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met
- [ ] Sprint demo prepared
- [ ] Handoff documentation complete

## Next Sprint Preparation

**Handoff to Sprint 3**:
- Merge engine ready for conflict detection
