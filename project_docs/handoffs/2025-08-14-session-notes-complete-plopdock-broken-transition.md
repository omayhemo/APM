### Key Architectural Achievements

#### 1. **Complete Technical Specification**
```
📁 Session Notes Enforcement Hook Architecture
├── 🏗️ Core Components
│   ├── SessionStateTracker - Track session note path, updates, active agent
│   ├── AgentDetectionSystem - Multi-signal identification of active persona

#### 3. **Complete Hook Event Analysis**
| Hook Event | Implementation | Use Case | Status |
|------------|----------------|----------|---------|
| `user_prompt_submit` | ✅ DESIGNED | Detect agent activation commands | Ready |
| `pre_tool_use` | ✅ DESIGNED | Enforce note creation/updates | Ready |
| `post_tool_use` | ✅ DESIGNED | Validate session note creation | Ready |
| `pre_compact` | ✅ DESIGNED | Archive before context loss | Ready |

## 🔴 PLOPDOCK HOOK - FUNDAMENTAL ARCHITECTURAL FAILURE

### Critical Problem Analysis

#### The Core Issue: **Architectural Mismatch**
The Plopdock hook implementation suffers from a **fundamental misunderstanding** of how Claude Code hooks work:

```
❌ BROKEN ASSUMPTION: Hooks can invoke MCP tools directly
✅ ACTUAL REALITY: Hooks can only modify tool parameters

❌ BROKEN ASSUMPTION: Hooks work like CLI tools with stdin/stdout
✅ ACTUAL REALITY: Hooks receive function parameters and return modified parameters

❌ BROKEN ASSUMPTION: Hooks can execute alternative tool calls
✅ ACTUAL REALITY: Hooks can only transform the current tool call parameters
```

#### Evidence of Architectural Confusion

**File**: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/installer/templates/hooks/pre_tool_use_plopdock.py`

**❌ BROKEN PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:**

1. **CLI-style Input/Output** (Lines 162-167):
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Hooks don't use stdin/stdout
try:
    request = json.load(sys.stdin)
except json.JSONDecodeError:
    # Not JSON, pass through
    sys.exit(0)
```

2. **MCP Tool Invocation Attempt** (Lines 194-210):
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Hooks cannot invoke MCP tools
mcp_command = {
    "tool": {
        "name": "server:start",  # This is an MCP tool call!
        "parameters": {
            "command": command,
            "cwd": project_info["cwd"],
            "sessionName": f"{project_info['project_name']}-{project_info['framework']}"
        }
    }
}
```

3. **Special Exit Codes** (Line 240):
```python
# ❌ WRONG: Claude Code hooks don't use special exit codes for tool redirection
sys.exit(100)  # This does nothing in Claude Code hook context
```

#### The "Fixed" Version Still Broken

**File**: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/installer/templates/hooks/pre_tool_use_plopdock_fixed.py`

**Improvements Made**:
- ✅ Correct function signature: `pre_tool_use_hook(tool_name, params, context=None)`
- ✅ Proper parameter modification: Returns modified `params` dictionary
- ✅ Removed stdin/stdout CLI patterns

**Still Broken**:
- ❌ **Cannot invoke MCP tools**: The hook can only block the bash command, not execute alternatives
- ❌ **User Experience Failure**: Blocking commands without providing actionable alternatives
- ❌ **Architectural Impossibility**: The fundamental goal (redirect to MCP) cannot be achieved by hooks

### What Hooks Actually Can and Cannot Do

#### ✅ WHAT HOOKS CAN DO:
```python
def pre_tool_use_hook(tool_name, params, context=None):
    """Hooks can ONLY modify tool parameters"""
    
    # ✅ Can modify command parameters
    if tool_name == "Bash":
        original_command = params["command"]
        params["command"] = f"echo 'Modified: {original_command}'"
    
    # ✅ Can modify file paths
    if tool_name == "Write":
        params["file_path"] = correct_file_location(params["file_path"])
    
    # ✅ Can block operations (by modifying to safe no-ops)
    if dangerous_operation(params):
        params["command"] = "echo 'Operation blocked for safety'"
    
    return params  # Return modified parameters
```

#### ❌ WHAT HOOKS CANNOT DO:
```python
def pre_tool_use_hook(tool_name, params, context=None):
    """Hooks CANNOT do any of these things"""
    
    # ❌ CANNOT invoke other tools
    mcp_tool_call("mcp__plopdock__host_start", {...})  # IMPOSSIBLE
    
    # ❌ CANNOT execute alternative commands
    subprocess.run(["some", "other", "command"])  # WRONG ARCHITECTURE
    
    # ❌ CANNOT redirect tool calls to different tools
    return {"tool_name": "DifferentTool", "params": {...}}  # NOT HOW IT WORKS
    
    # ❌ CANNOT use special exit codes to trigger behaviors
    sys.exit(100)  # MEANINGLESS IN HOOK CONTEXT
```

### User Frustration Context

**The user is EXTREMELY frustrated because**:

1. **Broken Promises**: The hook was supposed to seamlessly integrate Bash commands with Plopdock MCP tools
2. **Architectural Impossibility**: The fundamental design goal cannot be achieved with hooks
3. **Repeated Failed Attempts**: Multiple "fixed" versions that still don't work
4. **Lack of Clear Explanation**: No clear communication about why this approach is impossible

### Correct Architectural Solutions

#### Option 1: **User Education + Manual Process**
```
❌ CURRENT: Try to automatically redirect `npm run dev` to Plopdock
✅ ALTERNATIVE: Hook provides clear instructions to manually use MCP tools

Implementation:
- Hook detects dev server commands
- Modifies command to echo helpful instructions
- User manually runs the correct MCP tool calls
```

#### Option 2: **Claude Code Feature Request**
```
❌ CURRENT: Try to work around hook limitations
✅ ALTERNATIVE: Request new hook capability for tool call redirection

Requirement:
- New hook type that can return alternative tool calls
- Example: pre_tool_use_redirect hook that returns different tool
```

#### Option 3: **External Integration Layer**
```
❌ CURRENT: Try to handle in hooks
✅ ALTERNATIVE: External process that monitors and suggests

Implementation:
- Background process watches for dev server commands
- Sends notifications/suggestions to user
- User decides whether to use MCP tools or proceed
```

#### Option 4: **MCP Server Enhancement**
```
❌ CURRENT: Try to intercept at hook level
✅ ALTERNATIVE: Enhance Plopdock MCP to auto-detect dev servers

Implementation:
- Plopdock MCP monitors file system for package.json changes
- Auto-suggests project registration when dev activity detected
- Provides easy single-command project setup
```

## 🚨 CRITICAL ARCHITECTURAL INSIGHTS FOR NEXT TEAM

### Session Notes Hook - Ready for Implementation
1. **Architecture Complete**: Full technical design and specifications ready
2. **Pattern Proven**: Based on successful 846-line location enforcer
3. **Risk Mitigated**: Non-blocking design with comprehensive fallbacks
4. **Integration Mapped**: Clear hook points and existing infrastructure reuse

### Plopdock Hook - Fundamental Redesign Required
1. **Current Approach Invalid**: Cannot achieve goals with hook architecture
2. **User Expectations Misaligned**: Promised functionality architecturally impossible
3. **Alternative Solutions Available**: Multiple viable approaches identified
4. **Decision Required**: Choose new architectural approach before any coding

### Key Constraints to Remember
```
HOOK CONSTRAINTS (These are hard limits, not design choices):
✅ Hooks can modify parameters of the current tool call
✅ Hooks can block operations (by replacing with safe commands)
✅ Hooks can validate and correct inputs
✅ Hooks can log and audit activities

❌ Hooks CANNOT invoke other tools or MCP servers
❌ Hooks CANNOT execute alternative commands
❌ Hooks CANNOT redirect tool calls to different tools
❌ Hooks CANNOT use special exit codes for flow control
```

## ⚠️ FINAL WARNING

**DO NOT ATTEMPT TO "FIX" THE PLOPDOCK HOOK WITH THE CURRENT APPROACH**

The architectural mismatch is fundamental and cannot be resolved by code changes. Any attempt to continue with hook-based MCP tool invocation will result in:

1. **Continued User Frustration**: Broken promises and failed implementations
2. **Wasted Development Time**: Working on architecturally impossible solutions
3. **System Instability**: Hacks and workarounds that may break Claude Code
4. **Technical Debt**: Code that doesn't align with Claude Code's design

**INSTEAD**: Choose one of the 4 alternative architectural approaches and implement it properly.

**Transition Status**: 🟢 SESSION NOTES READY | 🔴 PLOPDOCK REQUIRES REDESIGN  
**Next Required Action**: Implement Session Notes Hook + Choose Plopdock Alternative  
**User Communication**: CRITICAL - Must explain Plopdock constraints honestly
