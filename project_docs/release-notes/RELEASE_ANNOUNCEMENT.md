# üöÄ APM Framework v4.0.0 - Official Release

## Agentic Persona Mapping (APM) - Native Sub-Agent Architecture for Claude Code

We're excited to announce the official release of **APM Framework v4.0.0**, a revolutionary development framework that transforms Claude Code into a multi-persona development team with true parallel execution capabilities.

### üéØ What is APM?

The Agentic Persona Mapping (APM) framework enables Claude Code to operate as specialized development personas (Architect, Developer, QA, Product Owner, etc.) with native sub-agent parallelism, delivering **4-8x performance improvements** over traditional sequential workflows.

### üì¶ Repository

**GitHub Repository:** https://github.com/omayhemo/APM

The APM repository contains the universal installer and latest releases. This is a dedicated distribution repository, separate from the development repository, ensuring clean and reliable installations.

### üìã Prerequisites

**Claude Code CLI is required** to use the APM Framework. If you don't have Claude Code installed:

1. Install Claude Code from: https://claude.ai/download
2. Or via npm: `npm install -g @anthropic/claude-cli`
3. Authenticate with: `claude login`

Claude Code is Anthropic's official CLI that enables AI-powered development directly in your terminal.

### üîß Installation

Once Claude Code is installed, install APM directly into your project with a single command:

```bash
cd /path/to/your/project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omayhemo/APM/master/install.sh | bash
```

**Installation Options:**
- `--defaults` - Install with default settings (non-interactive)
- Interactive mode - Choose installation preferences when run without flags

The installer will create a `.apm/` directory in your project containing all APM infrastructure, personas, and documentation.

### üìö Documentation

After installation, comprehensive documentation is available at:

- **Main Documentation:** `.apm/README.md` - Complete guide to APM framework, commands, and personas
- **Detailed Guides:** `.apm/documentation/` - 80+ documentation files organized by topic:
  - `01-getting-started/` - Quick start guides and tutorials
  - `02-personas/` - Individual persona capabilities and usage
  - `03-workflows/` - Common development workflows
  - `04-configuration/` - Settings and customization
  - `05-advanced/` - Advanced features and patterns

### üöÄ Getting Started

1. **Ensure Claude Code is installed:**
   ```bash
   claude --version  # Check if Claude Code is installed
   # If not installed, get it from: https://claude.ai/download
   ```

2. **Install APM in your project:**
   ```bash
   cd /path/to/your/project
   curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omayhemo/APM/master/install.sh | bash
   ```

3. **Launch Claude Code in your project:**
   ```bash
   claude  # Start Claude Code in your project directory
   ```

4. **Activate the AP Orchestrator:**
   ```
   /ap
   ```

5. **Read the documentation:**
   ```bash
   cat .apm/README.md
   # or explore specific topics
   ls .apm/documentation/
   ```

6. **Start developing with specialized personas:**
   - `/analyst` - Begin with research and analysis
   - `/architect` - Design your system architecture
   - `/dev` - Implement features with the Developer persona
   - `/qa` - Test and validate your implementation

### üí° Example Workflow

```bash
# 1. Install APM in your project
cd /path/to/your/project
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omayhemo/APM/master/install.sh | bash

# 2. Start Claude Code
claude

# 3. Inside Claude Code, activate the orchestrator
/ap

# 4. Start a parallel sprint with multiple developers
/parallel-sprint

# 5. Run comprehensive QA with parallel execution
/parallel-qa-framework
```
