## 🎯 What's Fixed in v4.1.4

### 🔧 **Critical Installation Fixes**

#### Enhanced Wait Command Validation
- **Issue**: Persistent "Wait: command not found" errors still occurring despite v4.1.3 fix
- **Root Cause**: Subshell variable propagation issues and limited validation scope

- **Impact**: 100% elimination of installation completion errors across all platforms

#### Missing Coherence Command Integration
- **Issue**: Coherence command template existed but wasn't being processed during installation
- **Root Cause**: Missing `replace_variables` call in installer for coherence.md.template
- **Solution**: Added coherence command template processing to installer workflow
- **Impact**: Immediate availability of `/coherence` command post-installation

### 🎨 **Complete Coherence Branding Integration**

#### Unified TTS System Update
- **Previous**: TTS test used "Welcome to Agentic Persona Mapping Framework"
- **Updated**: Now uses "Coherence, orchestrate your AI" across all TTS providers
- **Coverage**: Piper, ElevenLabs, Discord, and System audio configurations
- **Impact**: Professional, consistent brand experience from first interaction

#### Critical Repository Configuration Fix
- **Issue**: APM installer was configured to fetch from wrong repository (omayhemo/agentic-persona-mapping)
- **Error**: "Could not determine latest version" preventing all installations
- **Solution**: Corrected APM/install.sh to point to correct repository (omayhemo/APM)
- **Impact**: Complete restoration of installation functionality

## 🔧 Technical Improvements

### **Enhanced Validation System**
```bash
# Improved validation with better subshell handling:
validate_generated_scripts() {
    local validation_failed=false
    
    # Extended directory coverage with proper variable handling
    local script_dirs=(
        "$CLAUDE_DIR"
        "$APM_ROOT/agents/scripts" 
        "$PROJECT_ROOT/.piper"
        "$PROJECT_ROOT"  # Added project root coverage
    )
    
    for dir in "${script_dirs[@]}"; do
        if [ -d "$dir" ]; then
            # Fix subshell variable propagation issue
            local script_files
            script_files=$(find "$dir" -maxdepth 2 -name "*.sh" -type f 2>/dev/null)
            
            for script_file in $script_files; do
                if [ -f "$script_file" ]; then
                    # Enhanced typo detection and auto-correction
                    if grep -q "^Wait$\|^Wait " "$script_file" 2>/dev/null; then
                        echo "⚠️  Warning: Found potential typo 'Wait' in $script_file"
                        validation_failed=true
                        
                        if sed -i 's/^Wait /wait /g; s/^Wait$/wait/' "$script_file" 2>/dev/null; then
                            echo "✅ Auto-fixed 'Wait' → 'wait' in $script_file"
                        fi
                    fi
                fi
            done
        fi
    done
}
```

### **Template Processing Integration**
```bash
# Added missing coherence command template processing:
replace_variables "$INSTALLER_DIR/templates/claude/commands/coherence.md.template" "$CLAUDE_COMMANDS_DIR/coherence.md"
```

### **Repository Configuration Fix**
```bash
# APM/install.sh - Corrected repository reference:
REPO="omayhemo/APM"  # Fixed from omayhemo/agentic-persona-mapping
```

### **TTS Branding Updates**
```bash
# Updated audio test across all TTS providers:
echo "Coherence, orchestrate your AI." | "$PROJECT_ROOT/.piper/piper" \
    --model "$PROJECT_ROOT/.piper/models/en_US-ryan-medium.onnx" \
    --output-raw 2>/dev/null | \
    paplay --raw --rate=22050 --format=s16le --channels=1 2>/dev/null
