# Coherence v4.1.5 - Enhanced TTS Audio Experience

**Unified Context Engineering Platform**

**Release Date**: August 16, 2025  
**Version**: 4.1.5  
**Type**: Patch Release  

## üé§ Enhanced TTS Audio Experience

### Natural Speech Delivery Improvements
- **Added speech variable**: Introduced `SPEECHSENTENCE="Coherence. Orchestrate YOUR AI"` for consistent TTS messaging
- **Natural pause implementation**: Added `--sentence_silence 0.8` parameter to create natural breath between "Coherence." and "Orchestrate YOUR AI"
- **Improved speech clarity**: Enhanced audio delivery with proper punctuation and timing for better user experience
- **Consistent messaging**: Unified TTS message format across all audio providers

### TTS System Enhancements
- **Enhanced speech parameters**: Optimized sentence silence timing for natural conversation flow
- **Multi-provider support**: Consistent natural pause implementation across all audio players:
  - PulseAudio (paplay) - WSL2 optimized
  - ALSA (aplay) - Linux native
  - SoX (play) - Cross-platform
  - Generic audio player fallback
- **Professional audio quality**: Improved speech delivery that sounds more natural and engaging

## üìã Technical Implementation

### Speech Variable Implementation
```bash
# New speech sentence variable for consistency
SPEECHSENTENCE="Coherence. Orchestrate YOUR AI"

# Enhanced TTS command with natural pause
echo "$SPEECHSENTENCE" | "$PROJECT_ROOT/.piper/piper" \
    --model "$PROJECT_ROOT/.piper/models/en_US-ryan-medium.onnx" \
    --sentence_silence 0.8 \
    --output-raw 2>/dev/null | \
    paplay --raw --rate=22050 --format=s16le --channels=1 2>/dev/null
```

### Sentence Silence Integration
- **Timing optimization**: 0.8-second pause provides natural breath between phrases
