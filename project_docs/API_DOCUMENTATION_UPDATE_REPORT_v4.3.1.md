### Scrum Master (SM) Persona - DEPRECATED v4.3.2

- **Migration Path**: Use Product Owner (`/po`) for all SM functionality
- **Documentation Updated**:
  - All command references show SM as deprecated

  - Functionality mapping to PO documented

### Design Architect ‚Üí Designer
- **Status**: Fully migrated to "Designer" terminology
- **Backward Compatibility**: `/design-architect` still works with deprecation warning

## üìä Business Case Command Analysis

**Finding**: The `planning-business-case` command referenced in documentation templates is not yet implemented in the active `.claude/commands/` directory. The template exists but has not been instantiated.

**Recommendation**: Consider implementing the business case command or updating documentation to reflect current command availability.
