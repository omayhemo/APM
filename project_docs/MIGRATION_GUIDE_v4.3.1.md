## ✅ Validation Checklist

### Post-Migration Validation

```bash
# 1. Verify Installation
cat .apm/VERSION                    # Should show 4.3.2
/coherence                         # Should activate successfully

# 2. Test New Commands
/planning-business-case            # Should launch with 18 parallel sub-agents
/designer                         # Should launch design persona

# 3. Test Migrated Workflows
/po                               # Should include sprint planning capabilities
/planning-groom                   # Should provide AI-powered grooming

# 4. Verify Performance
time /planning-business-case      # Should complete in ~45 seconds

# 5. Check Documentation
ls .claude/commands/ | wc -l     # Should show 70+ commands
grep -r "sm" .claude/commands/   # Should return minimal results
grep -r "designer" .claude/commands/ | head -3  # Should show designer command
```

### Version-Specific Validation

**For v4.3.0 → v4.3.2 Upgrades:**
```bash
# Check documentation consistency
grep -r "v4.3.2" project_docs/   # Should show updated references
ls project_docs/docs/v4.3.2-*    # Should show v4.3.2 feature comparison
```

**For v4.2.0 → v4.3.2 Upgrades:**
```bash
# Verify removed commands are gone
ls .claude/commands/sm.md 2>/dev/null || echo "SM correctly removed"
ls .claude/commands/design-architect.md 2>/dev/null || echo "design-architect correctly removed"

# Verify new commands exist
ls .claude/commands/planning-business-case.md
ls .claude/commands/designer.md
```

### Common Issues and Solutions

**Issue: `/sm` command not found**
```bash
# Solution: Use replacement commands
/po                    # For most SM functionality
/planning-business-case # For comprehensive planning
/coherence             # For team coordination
```

**Issue: `design-architect` references not working**
```bash
# Solution: Update to new naming
/designer              # New command name
# Update any custom scripts with old references
```

**Issue: Performance not improved after upgrade**
```bash
# Solution: Verify v4.3.2 installation
/coherence | head -5   # Should mention v4.3.2 and native sub-agents
# If not, reinstall v4.3.2
```

**Issue: Documentation references old versions**
```bash
# Solution: Refresh documentation
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/omayhemo/APM/master/install.sh | bash -s -- --version 4.3.2 --force-update
```
