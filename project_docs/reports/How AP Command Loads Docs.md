‚óè üìã AP Command Execution Analysis - Step by Step

  When you type /ap, here's exactly what happens and what documents get loaded:

  Step 1: Command Recognition

  Source: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/CLAUDE.md (lines 69-89)
  - System recognizes /ap as an alias for /ap_orchestrator
  - Triggers the MANDATORY SEQUENCE for AP commands
  - Instructions state: "YOU (Claude) BECOME the agent persona"

  Step 2: Directory Listing - Session Notes

  Action: LS /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/
  - Why: Check existing session notes to understand context
  - What's loaded: Directory listing only (no files read)
  - Critical: CLAUDE.md explicitly states "DO NOT try to read current_session.md"

  Step 3: Directory Listing - Rules

  Action: LS /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/rules/
  - Why: Check for behavioral rules
  - What's loaded: Directory listing only (typically contains doc-standards.yaml)
  - Critical: CLAUDE.md explicitly states "DO NOT try to read rules.md"

  Step 4: Create Session Note

  Action: Write new file /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-AP-Orchestrator-Activation.md
  - What's created: New markdown file with session template
  - Content: Objectives, Progress, Decisions Made, Issues, Next Steps

  Step 5: Voice Greeting

  Action: Execute bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh
  - Message: "AP Orchestrator activated. Loading APM framework..."
  - Purpose: Audio notification of activation

  Step 6: Parallel Initialization (5 Concurrent Tasks)

  Source: Referenced in CLAUDE.md as "5 Tasks in one function_calls block"

  Task 1: Load APM Knowledge Base

  Target: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/CLAUDE.md
  - Content: Complete APM framework instructions
  - Key elements: Agent commands, behavioral rules, version info
  - Size: Comprehensive framework documentation

  Task 2: Load Configuration

  Target: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/config.yaml
  - Content: System configuration settings
  - Key elements: Voice settings, paths, agent configurations
  - Note: This file might not exist (returns configuration from settings.json)

  Task 3: Analyze Personas

  Target: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/
  - Action: List all persona directories
  - Personas found:
    - ap_orchestrator.md
    - analyst.md
    - architect.md
    - dev.md
    - pm.md
    - po.md
    - qa.md
    - sm.md
    - designer.md

  Task 4: Check Commands

  Target: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/commands/
  - Action: List all command files
  - Commands found: All /parallel-* commands, QA commands, etc.
  - Purpose: Understand available operations

  Task 5: Load Project State

  Target: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/backlog.md
  - Content: Current sprint status, active stories, blockers
  - Key info: Epic progress, story assignments, completion status

  Step 7: Secondary Voice Announcements

  - Status announcement about framework readiness
  - Capabilities overview

  Step 8: Present Orchestrator Interface

  - Display available agents
  - Show revolutionary capabilities
  - Present action options

  üìÇ Documents Loaded Into Context

  Primary Documents (Always Loaded)

  1. CLAUDE.md (project root) - Initial instructions triggering AP mode
  2. .apm/CLAUDE.md - Complete APM framework documentation
  3. backlog.md - Current project state and active work

  Configuration Data (Extracted)

  1. Settings.json paths and voice configurations
  2. Agent persona definitions (metadata only)
  3. Command definitions (metadata only)

  What's NOT Loaded

  - Individual persona files (only listed)
  - Command implementation details (only listed)
  - Task files
  - Template files
  - Session note contents (only directory listing)

  Total Context Impact

  - Initial Load: ~3-5 documents fully read
  - Metadata: ~50+ files cataloged but not read
  - Memory Usage: Moderate (most content is listed, not loaded)

  üîÑ Process Flow Summary

  User types: /ap
      ‚Üì
  1. Check session notes directory (LS only)
  2. Check rules directory (LS only)
  3. Create new session note
  4. Voice greeting
  5. Launch 5 parallel tasks:
     - Load APM knowledge base
     - Load configuration
     - Analyze personas
     - Check commands
     - Load project state
  6. Voice status updates
  7. Present orchestrator interface

  The entire process loads the essential framework context while keeping the initial memory footprint manageable through strategic use of listing vs. reading operations.

‚óè Bash(bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh "Analysis complete. The AP command loads 3 to 5 core documents while cataloging‚Ä¶)
  ‚éø ¬†(No content)

‚úª Thinking‚Ä¶

  The user wanted to understand exactly what happens when /ap is run, what gets loaded, and where the instructions come from. I've provided a detailed step-by-step walkthrough showing:

  1. The exact source of instructions (CLAUDE.md files)
  2. Each step in the mandatory sequence
  3. What directories are listed vs what files are read
  4. The parallel initialization with 5 concurrent tasks
  5. A summary of documents loaded into context

  This gives them a clear understanding of the /ap command's execution flow and memory impact.
