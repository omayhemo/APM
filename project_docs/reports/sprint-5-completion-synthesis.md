✅ **Section Management** (Stories 2.1-2.5) - 20 points  
✅ **Conflict Resolution** (Stories 3.1-3.3) - 12 points
✅ **Integration & UX** (Stories 4.1-4.3) - 11 points
✅ **Testing Framework** (Stories 5.1-5.3) - 10 points
⏳ **User Feedback** (Story 5.4) - 1 point
⏳ **Edge Cases** (Story 5.5) - 2 points
⏳ **Performance Optimization** (Stories 6.1-6.3) - 8 points
⏳ **Deployment** (Stories 8.1-8.3) - 10 points

## Next Steps - Sprint 6

### Recommended Sprint 6 Stories (14 points)
1. **Story 5.4**: User Feedback (1 pt)
2. **Story 5.5**: Edge Case Testing (2 pts)
3. **Story 6.1**: Performance Profiling (3 pts)
4. **Story 6.2**: Algorithm Optimization (3 pts)
5. **Story 7.5b**: Agent Time Tracking Integration (4 pts)
6. **Story 5.4**: User Feedback Loop (1 pt)

### Integration Points
- Performance optimization can leverage new benchmarking tools
- Time tracking integration builds on 7.5a infrastructure
- User feedback mechanisms use new UX components

## Lessons Learned

### What Worked Well
1. **Fast-Track Dependencies**: Prioritizing Story 5.1 unblocked 5.2 efficiently
2. **Clear Boundaries**: Each developer had well-defined scope
3. **Proactive Coordination**: Template modification sync between Dev 1 & 4
4. **Quality Focus**: All developers included tests and documentation

### Areas for Improvement
1. **Date Consistency**: Some completion timestamps show July instead of January
2. **Regex Issue**: Minor bug in time tracking utility noted for future fix
3. **Documentation Path**: Need to ensure consistent use of project_docs

## Conclusion

Sprint 5 achieved 100% completion through effective parallel development coordination. The Claude Merge System is now 71% complete with robust testing, performance benchmarking, and enhanced user experience. The system is approaching production readiness with only optimization and deployment stories remaining.
