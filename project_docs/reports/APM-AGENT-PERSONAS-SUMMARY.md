## ðŸš€ Revolutionary Features

### Parallel Sprint System (`/parallel-sprint`)
The Scrum Master can now coordinate **multiple Developer agents simultaneously**:
- Launches 2-4 Developer agents working concurrently
- Real-time dependency management
- 60-80% sprint acceleration
- Intelligent conflict prevention
- Comprehensive progress synthesis

### Parallel Execution Benefits
Most agents support parallel task execution for dramatic performance improvements:
- 65-85% time reduction on complex tasks
- Multi-dimensional analysis simultaneously
- Comprehensive coverage in single operations
- Intelligent synthesis of parallel results

---

## ðŸ“‹ Backlog Management

**Critical**: ALL agents must update `project_docs/backlog.md` after any story-related work:
- Immediate status updates when work begins/completes
- Progress percentage tracking
- Acceptance criteria validation
- Dependency documentation
- Blocker reporting

---

## ðŸ”„ Agent Handoff Commands

- `/handoff [agent]` - Direct transition to another persona
- `/switch` - Compact session before switching
- `/wrap` - Archive session and create summary

---

## ðŸŽ¯ Quick Activation Reference

| Agent | Primary Command | Alternative |
