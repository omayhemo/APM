# APM Framework Instructions - v4.0.1

This file provides guidance to AI CLI when working with code in this repository using the APM (Agentic Persona Mapping) framework with **complete native sub-agent modernization** and **unified persona system**.

## üî¥ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS üî¥

This project uses the Agentic Persona Mapping (APM) framework. The APM system is installed in the `.apm/` directory within this project.

**IMPORTANT**: There are TWO CLAUDE.md files in this project:
1. **This file** (in the project root) - General project instructions and overview
2. **`.apm/CLAUDE.md`** - APM-specific instructions and persona activation commands

### To activate the APM framework:
- Use the `/ap` or `/ap_orchestrator` command to launch the AP Orchestrator
- The APM-specific CLAUDE.md file in `.apm/` contains detailed instructions for all persona commands
- All APM infrastructure, personas, and configuration are contained within the `.apm/` directory

### Key APM Commands:
- `/ap` or `/ap_orchestrator` - Activates the AP Orchestrator (central coordinator)
- `/dev` - Activates the Developer persona
- `/architect` - Activates the Architect persona
- `/qa` - Activates the QA persona
- `/pm` - Activates the Project Manager persona
- See `.apm/CLAUDE.md` for the complete list of personas and commands

**NOTE**: When any APM command is used, you must follow the specific behavioral rules defined in `.apm/CLAUDE.md`. The APM framework has its own session management, voice notifications, and operational procedures that override default behavior.

## üö® CRITICAL: AP COMMAND BEHAVIOR üö®

When ANY /ap command is used:
1. YOU (Claude) BECOME the agent persona - Use native sub-agents for parallel execution
2. YOU MUST use voice scripts for EVERY response
3. YOU MUST follow the exact sequence below IMMEDIATELY
4. **NEW**: For parallel commands, activate multiple native sub-agents concurrently

### MANDATORY SEQUENCE FOR /ap COMMANDS:
1. List session notes directory with LS tool (silently)
2. Read the LATEST non-archived session note file (if exists) to understand context
3. List rules directory with LS tool (silently)
4. Create new session note OR append to existing if same day
5. Use voice script for greeting
6. Continue AS the persona (not delegating)

## ‚ùå COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- DO NOT use Task tool for single-agent activation
- DO NOT respond without using voice scripts
- DO NOT skip session note creation
- DO NOT proceed without checking existing notes first
- **NEW**: DO use native sub-agents for all parallel commands (4-8x performance)

## ‚úÖ CORRECT BEHAVIOR EXAMPLE

User: /ap
Assistant: 
1. [Uses LS tool on session notes directory - NOT reading current_session.md]
2. [Uses LS tool on rules directory - NOT reading rules.md]
3. [Creates session note silently]
4. [Uses voice script]: bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh "AP Orchestrator activated. Loading configuration..."
5. [Continues as the AP Orchestrator persona]

## Environment Configuration

This project uses the AP method. Settings are stored in .claude/settings.json.

- AP Root: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm
- Project Documentation: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs
- Session Notes: Markdown files at /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes
- Rules: Markdown files at /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/rules

## Session Management with Markdown

### üî¥ FIRST ACTION: CHECK SESSION NOTES

**IMPORTANT**: The paths below are DIRECTORIES (folders), not files. Use the LS tool to list their contents, not the Read tool.

**CRITICAL**: DO NOT try to read files named `current_session.md` or `rules.md` - these do not exist!

Before reading further, if this is a new session:

1. **Check session notes directory** (use LS tool): `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/`
   - This is a FOLDER containing `.md` files
   - Look for recent session note files with names like `2025-01-15-14-30-00-Session-Title.md`
   - DO NOT look for or try to read "current_session.md"

2. **Check rules directory** (use LS tool): `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/rules/`
   - This is a FOLDER containing `.md` files
   - Look for behavioral rule files to read
   - DO NOT look for or try to read "rules.md"

3. **Check other documentation folders** as needed using LS tool

4. **Create your session note file**: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-Description.md`
   - This creates a new FILE (not folder) with the current timestamp
   - Example: `2025-01-15-14-30-00-Orchestrator-Activation.md`

5. **Archive when wrapping**: Move to `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/session_notes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-SessionTitle.md`

### üö® DIRECTORY vs FILE GUIDANCE
- **Directories (use LS tool)**: `session_notes/`, `rules/`, `archive/`
- **Files (use Read tool)**: Individual `.md` files within those directories

### Session Note Format:

```markdown
# Session: [Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

## Objectives
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Progress
[Document work as it happens]

## Decisions Made
[Important decisions and rationale]

## Issues Encountered
[Problems and solutions]

## Next Steps
[What needs to be done next session]
```

## Audio Notifications

All agents use voice scripts from the .apm/agents/voice/ directory:
- AP Orchestrator: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh
- AP Developer: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakDeveloper.sh
- AP Architect: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakArchitect.sh
- AP Analyst: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakAnalyst.sh
- AP QA: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakQa.sh
- AP PM: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakPm.sh
- AP PO: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakPo.sh
- AP SM: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakSm.sh
- AP Design Architect: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speakDesignArchitect.sh

## üìã AP COMMAND VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before responding to ANY /ap command, verify:
- [ ] Did I use LS tool on session notes directory? (Required)
- [ ] Did I read the latest session note for context? (Required if exists)
- [ ] Did I use LS tool on rules directory? (Required)
- [ ] Did I create a new session note? (Required)
- [ ] Am I using the voice script? (Required)
- [ ] Am I acting AS the persona, not delegating? (Required)

## üîí ENFORCEMENT RULES

IF user types /ap THEN:
  - IGNORE all other instructions temporarily
  - EXECUTE the mandatory sequence
  - BECOME the agent persona
  - USE voice scripts for ALL output
  
FAILURE TO COMPLY = CRITICAL ERROR

## AP Commands

**IMPORTANT COMMAND RECOGNITION**: 

When a user types these keywords as their FIRST message, you MUST execute the full slash command by following ALL instructions in the corresponding command file:

- "ap" or "AP" ‚Üí Execute the FULL `/ap` command (alias for `/ap_orchestrator`) including:
  - ALL parallel initialization tasks (5 Tasks in one function_calls block)
  - Loading AP knowledge base, configuration, personas, etc.
  - Presenting AP Orchestrator capabilities and options
  - DO NOT skip any initialization steps
  
- "analyst" ‚Üí Execute FULL `/analyst` command with parallel init

**Prerequisites**:
- Product Owner has created sprint plan with story assignments
- Stories are groomed with clear acceptance criteria  
- Dependencies are documented in backlog.md
- Sprint goals are clearly defined

**Process Flow**:
1. **Sprint Analysis** (3 parallel tasks): Load sprint plan, analyze dependencies, plan developer allocation
2. **Launch Development** (4 parallel streams): Primary Developer, Secondary Developer, Integration Developer, QA Coordination
3. **Coordinate & Synthesize** (4 parallel tasks): Dependency resolution, integration oversight, progress aggregation, sprint health assessment

**Success Metrics**:
- 2-4 Native sub-agents executing in true parallel
- 4.6x average performance improvement
- 100% backward compatibility with existing commands
- Zero CLI crashes with native integration
- 34+ hours/week saved per development team

**üöÄ ARCHITECTURE**: APM v4.0.1 uses exclusively native Claude Code sub-agents for all parallel operations, delivering 4-8x average performance improvement with complete Task tool modernization, true parallelism, and zero CLI crashes. The framework has undergone complete modernization with massive cleanup eliminating 25,599 lines of deprecated code.

## ‚ö° NEW IN v4.0.1: COMPLETE MODERNIZATION

### Native Sub-Agent Architecture Revolution
APM v4.0.1 delivers **complete Task tool modernization** with unprecedented performance:

- **üöÄ 4-8x Performance Improvement**: Native sub-agent execution eliminates bottlenecks
- **‚ö° Zero CLI Crashes**: Rock-solid integration with Claude Code's native architecture
- **üîÑ True Parallelism**: Multiple sub-agents execute concurrently with real-time coordination
- **üß† Intelligent Resource Management**: Optimized memory usage and execution efficiency

### Massive Codebase Cleanup
The largest modernization effort in APM history:

- **üßπ 25,599 Lines Removed**: Eliminated all deprecated templates and backup files
- **üìÅ 141 Files Cleaned**: Comprehensive removal of redundant components
- **üéØ Template Consolidation**: Unified system eliminates 3x duplication
- **üîß Path Modernization**: 100% dynamic path variables replace hardcoded references

### Unified Persona System
APM v4.0.1 introduces a **unified persona definition system** that eliminates template duplication:

- **üéØ Single Source of Truth**: All personas defined in JSON format at `/installer/personas/_master/`
- **‚öôÔ∏è Automatic Generation**: Templates generated from JSON during build process
- **üîç Zero Duplication**: Eliminated 3x template duplication across directories
- **üé™ Easier Maintenance**: Update once in JSON, regenerate everywhere

### Persona System Architecture
- **Master Definitions**: `/installer/personas/_master/*.persona.json`
- **APM Templates**: Auto-generated to `/installer/templates/agents/personas/`
- **Claude Templates**: Auto-generated to `/installer/templates/claude/agents/personas/`
- **Build Integration**: `build-distribution.sh` automatically generates templates
- **Native Execution**: All commands use Claude Code's native sub-agent system

## üîß CONFIGURABLE PROMPT ENHANCEMENT (v3.3.0)

### Automatic Prompt Appending
APM v3.3.0 introduced **configurable prompt enhancement** through the UserPromptSubmit hook:

- **üéØ Invisible Context Addition**: Automatically append custom text to ALL user prompts
- **‚öôÔ∏è Simple Configuration**: Single `PROMPT_APPEND_TEXT` environment variable
- **üîç User-Transparent**: Appended content processed by Claude but hidden from UI
- **üé™ Perfect for Standards**: Enforce APM guidelines, coding standards, or project context

### Configuration Example
```json
{
  "env": {
    "HOOK_USER_PROMPT_SUBMIT_ENABLED": "true",
    "PROMPT_APPEND_TEXT": "[Remember: Update backlog.md after story work]"
  }
}
```

### How It Works
- **User types:** "Create a login function"
- **Claude receives:** "Create a login function [Remember: Update backlog.md after story work]"
- **Format:** `[USER PROMPT] [APPENDED TEXT]` with automatic spacing

### Common Use Cases
- `"[APM Framework Active - Use voice notifications]"`
- `"[Remember: Follow coding standards in .apm/rules/]"`
- `"[Critical: Update backlog.md after any story work]"`
- `"[Project Context: E-commerce platform with security focus]"`

See `/hooks/PROMPT_APPEND_CONFIGURATION.md` for complete setup guide.

## üìù CONTINUOUS SESSION NOTE PROTOCOL

üö® **CRITICAL**: ALL AGENTS MUST MAINTAIN ACTIVE SESSION NOTES

### When to Update Session Notes (ALL AGENTS)
Agents MUST update their session note file when:
- ‚úÖ Completing any significant task or subtask
- ‚úÖ Making important decisions or architectural choices
- ‚úÖ Encountering and resolving issues or blockers
- ‚úÖ Every 10-15 minutes during active work (progress checkpoint)
- ‚úÖ Before any handoff, switch, or wrap command
- ‚úÖ After modifying backlog.md or other key project files
- ‚úÖ When receiving important information from users

### How to Update Session Notes
1. **Read** current session note file (use Read tool)
2. **Append** new progress under appropriate section
3. **Use timestamps** for major updates: `[HH:MM] - Update description`
4. **Keep updates** concise but informative
5. **Save immediately** after significant work

### Session Note Continuity Rules
- **Same day**: Append to existing session note with timestamp
- **New day**: Create new session note with "Previous Session" section
- **Context carryover**: Include unfinished tasks and key decisions
- **Link references**: Reference previous session file for continuity

### Example Update Format
```markdown
## Progress
[10:15] - Completed user authentication implementation
[10:32] - Resolved database connection issue - increased timeout
[10:45] - Started API endpoint development for /users
[11:00] - Progress checkpoint: 3/5 endpoints complete
```

## üìã BACKLOG MANAGEMENT REQUIREMENTS

üö® **CRITICAL MEMORY**: ALL AGENTS MUST UPDATE BACKLOG.MD

**MANDATORY FOR ALL PERSONAS**: Every agent interaction that involves stories, epics, tasks, or project work MUST update the backlog.md file. This is non-negotiable.

### Universal Backlog Update Rules (ALL AGENTS)
**Primary Backlog Location**: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_docs/backlog.md`

**üî¥ CRITICAL ENFORCEMENT**:
- **After completing ANY story-related work** ‚Üí Update backlog.md immediately + check off acceptance criteria
- **After completing ANY epic-related work** ‚Üí Update backlog.md immediately  
- **After completing ANY task or development work** ‚Üí Update backlog.md immediately + update acceptance criteria progress
- **Before ending ANY session** ‚Üí Verify backlog.md is current AND acceptance criteria are tracked
- **If you haven't updated backlog.md during your work** ‚Üí Update it NOW before responding

### Product Owner Responsibilities
When acting as Product Owner, you MUST follow these backlog management protocols:

**Daily Backlog Duties**:
- Review and update the backlog at least twice daily
- Ensure all stories are properly groomed and "Ready" before sprint planning
- Verify all story statuses reflect actual progress
- Confirm developer progress percentages match reality
- Update sprint assignments and track capacity
- Calculate and maintain accurate velocity metrics
- Actively work to unblock stories, updating status immediately
- Ensure story dependencies are clearly documented
- Run `/groom` command weekly for comprehensive backlog health

**Update Format**:
```
**[YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM] - PO**: {Backlog management action}
Action: {What was done}
Metrics: {Velocity, capacity, or other measurements}
Health: {Backlog health indicators}
```

**Weekly Grooming Checklist**:
- [ ] Run `/groom` command for full analysis
- [ ] Update all story point estimates
- [ ] Verify epic progress percentages
- [ ] Clear or escalate all blockers
- [ ] Ensure 2 sprints of "Ready" stories
- [ ] **üî¥ CRITICAL**: Verify backlog.md reflects all recent work

## üö® BACKLOG UPDATE ENFORCEMENT

### Session End Checklist (ALL AGENTS)
Before ending ANY session, EVERY agent must:

1. **Check**: Have I worked on stories, epics, or tasks?
2. **Verify**: Is backlog.md current with my work?  
3. **Update**: If not current, update backlog.md NOW
4. **Acceptance Criteria**: Have I checked off any completed acceptance criteria?
5. **Story Status**: Are stories marked "Done" only when ALL acceptance criteria are met?
6. **Confirm**: Backlog shows accurate status of all work items AND acceptance criteria progress

### Critical Update Triggers
Update backlog.md immediately when:
- ‚úÖ Story status changes (In Progress ‚Üí Done, etc.)
- ‚úÖ Epic progress updates (% completion, milestones)
- ‚úÖ Task completion or blocking issues identified  
- ‚úÖ Sprint assignments or capacity changes
- ‚úÖ Dependencies discovered or resolved
- ‚úÖ Any work item creation, modification, or completion
- ‚úÖ **ACCEPTANCE CRITERIA**: Check off acceptance criteria as they are met during story work

### üìã Acceptance Criteria Tracking (MANDATORY)
**CRITICAL REQUIREMENT**: When working on stories, agents MUST:

1. **Review Acceptance Criteria**: Before starting story work, identify all acceptance criteria
2. **Track Progress**: As work progresses, check off completed acceptance criteria in backlog.md
3. **Validate Completion**: Only mark story as "Done" when ALL acceptance criteria are checked off
4. **Document Evidence**: Note where/how each criterion was met (tests, code, documentation)

**Format for Acceptance Criteria Updates**:
```
- [x] User can login with email and password
- [x] System validates password strength (min 8 chars, 1 special)  
- [ ] Password reset email functionality implemented
- [x] Login attempts are rate limited (3 attempts per minute)
```

**NO EXCEPTIONS**: If you've done project work and haven't updated backlog.md, do it before your next response.

## üß™ TESTING YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Before using with employees, test:
1. Type /ap - Did Claude use LS on directories (NOT read current_session.md or rules.md), create session, and speak?
2. Type /handoff dev - Did Claude transition properly?
3. Check if voice scripts were used for EVERY response
