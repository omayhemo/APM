## ðŸŽ­ COHERENCE - AGENTIC PERSONA MAPPING

**Unified Context Engineering**

---

### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL COMMAND ðŸ”´

**When the user types ANY of these as their first message:**
- `coherence`
- `ap`
- `ap_orchestrator` 
- `agents`
- `apm`

**â†’ IMMEDIATELY execute the `/coherence` command**

This launches the full Coherence Orchestrator initialization sequence, including:
- Loading unified context engineering system from `.apm/` directory
- Initializing all specialized agent personas with orchestrated intelligence
- Setting up seamless session management
- Presenting orchestrated coordination capabilities

---

### Coherence Framework Structure

The Coherence - Agentic Persona Mapping system provides:
- **Coherence Orchestrator**: Central coordination with unified context engineering
- **Specialized Agents**: Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer, QA, and more with orchestrated intelligence
- **Session Management**: Intelligent context preservation and seamless handoffs
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Unified transitions between personas with coherent output

All Coherence components are located in the `.apm/` directory.

---

**Remember**: `coherence` = Full Unified Context Engineering activation with orchestrated AI intelligence!

Legacy commands (`ap`, `ap_orchestrator`) redirect to `/coherence` for backward compatibility.
