### ðŸ”´ CRITICAL COMMAND ðŸ”´

**When the user types ANY of these as their first message:**
- `ap`
- `ap_orchestrator`
- `agents`
- `apm`

**â†’ IMMEDIATELY execute the `/ap_orchestrator` command**

This launches the full AP Orchestrator initialization sequence, including:
- Loading all APM infrastructure from `.apm/` directory
- Initializing all agent personas
- Setting up session management
- Presenting orchestrator capabilities

### APM Framework Structure

The Agentic Persona Mapping system provides:
- **AP Orchestrator**: Central coordination and delegation
- **Specialized Agents**: Analyst, PM, Architect, Developer, QA, and more
- **Session Management**: Intelligent context preservation and handoffs
- **Collaborative Workflow**: Seamless transitions between personas

All APM components are located in the `.apm/` directory.

**Remember**: `ap` = Full AP Orchestrator activation, not just a simple response!
