# AP Mapping Instructions

This file provides guidance to AI CLI when working with code in this repository using the AP (Agentic Persona) mapping.

## 🚨 CRITICAL: AP COMMAND BEHAVIOR 🚨

When ANY /ap command is used:
1. YOU (Claude) BECOME the agent persona - DO NOT use Task tool
2. YOU MUST use voice scripts for EVERY response
3. YOU MUST follow the exact sequence below IMMEDIATELY

### MANDATORY SEQUENCE FOR /ap COMMANDS:
1. Check session notes FIRST (silently)
2. Check rules (silently)
3. Create new session note (silently)
4. Use voice script for greeting
5. Continue AS the persona (not delegating)

## ❌ COMMON MISTAKES TO AVOID

- DO NOT use the Task tool to "launch" agents
- DO NOT respond without using voice scripts
- DO NOT skip session note creation
- DO NOT proceed without checking existing notes first
- DO NOT treat /ap commands as delegations

## ✅ CORRECT BEHAVIOR EXAMPLE

User: /ap
Assistant: 
1. [Checks session notes silently]
2. [Checks rules silently]
3. [Creates session note silently]
4. [Uses voice script]: bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh "AP Orchestrator activated. Loading configuration..."
5. [Continues as the AP Orchestrator persona]

## Environment Configuration

This project uses the AP method. Settings are stored in .claude/settings.json.

- AP Root: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents
- Project Documentation: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation
- Session Notes: Markdown files at /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation/session_notes
- Rules: Markdown files at /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation/rules

## Session Management with Markdown

### 🔴 FIRST ACTION: CHECK SESSION NOTES

**IMPORTANT**: The paths below are DIRECTORIES (folders), not files. Use the LS tool to list their contents, not the Read tool.

Before reading further, if this is a new session:

1. **Check session notes directory** (use LS tool): `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation/session_notes/`
   - This is a FOLDER containing `.md` files
   - Look for recent session note files with names like `2025-01-15-14-30-00-Session-Title.md`

2. **Check rules directory** (use LS tool): `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation/rules/`
   - This is a FOLDER containing `.md` files
   - Look for behavioral rule files to read

3. **Check other documentation folders** as needed using LS tool

4. **Create your session note file**: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation/session_notes/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-Description.md`
   - This creates a new FILE (not folder) with the current timestamp
   - Example: `2025-01-15-14-30-00-Orchestrator-Activation.md`

5. **Archive when wrapping**: Move to `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation/session_notes/archive/YYYY-MM-DD-HH-mm-ss-SessionTitle.md`

### 🚨 DIRECTORY vs FILE GUIDANCE
- **Directories (use LS tool)**: `session_notes/`, `rules/`, `archive/`
- **Files (use Read tool)**: Individual `.md` files within those directories

### Session Note Format:

```markdown
# Session: [Title]
Date: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS

## Objectives
- [ ] Task 1
- [ ] Task 2

## Progress
[Document work as it happens]

## Decisions Made
[Important decisions and rationale]

## Issues Encountered
[Problems and solutions]

## Next Steps
[What needs to be done next session]
```

## Audio Notifications

All agents use voice scripts from the agents/voice/ directory:
- AP Orchestrator: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakOrchestrator.sh
- AP Developer: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakDeveloper.sh
- AP Architect: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakArchitect.sh
- AP Analyst: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakAnalyst.sh
- AP QA: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakQA.sh
- AP PM: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakPM.sh
- AP PO: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakPO.sh
- AP SM: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakSM.sh
- AP Design Architect: /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/agents/voice/speakDesignArchitect.sh

## 📋 AP COMMAND VALIDATION CHECKLIST

Before responding to ANY /ap command, verify:
- [ ] Did I check session notes? (Required)
- [ ] Did I check rules? (Required)
- [ ] Did I create a new session note? (Required)
- [ ] Am I using the voice script? (Required)
- [ ] Am I acting AS the persona, not delegating? (Required)

## 🔒 ENFORCEMENT RULES

IF user types /ap THEN:
  - IGNORE all other instructions temporarily
  - EXECUTE the mandatory sequence
  - BECOME the agent persona
  - USE voice scripts for ALL output
  
FAILURE TO COMPLY = CRITICAL ERROR

## AP Commands

**IMPORTANT COMMAND RECOGNITION**: 

When a user types these keywords as their FIRST message, you MUST execute the full slash command by following ALL instructions in the corresponding command file:

- "ap" or "AP" → Execute the FULL `/ap` command (alias for `/ap_orchestrator`) including:
  - ALL parallel initialization tasks (5 Tasks in one function_calls block)
  - Loading AP knowledge base, configuration, personas, etc.
  - Presenting AP Orchestrator capabilities and options
  - DO NOT skip any initialization steps
  
- "analyst" → Execute FULL `/analyst` command with parallel init
- "architect" → Execute FULL `/architect` command with parallel init  
- "pm" → Execute FULL `/pm` command with parallel init
- "po" → Execute FULL `/po` command with parallel init
- "qa" → Execute FULL `/qa` command with parallel init
- "dev" or "developer" → Execute FULL `/dev` command with parallel init
- "sm" → Execute FULL `/sm` command with parallel init
- "design architect" → Execute FULL `/design-architect` command with parallel init

**CRITICAL**: You must execute the COMPLETE command as defined in `.claude/commands/[command].md`, not just activate the persona.

### Core AP Commands

### /ap - Launch AP Orchestrator (alias for /ap_orchestrator)
**IMPORTANT**: This makes YOU become the AP Orchestrator.
- Step 1: Check session notes directory using LS tool: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation/session_notes/`
- Step 2: Check rules directory using LS tool: `/mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/project_documentation/rules/`
- Step 3: Create new session note FILE with timestamp (not a directory)
- Step 4: Use speakOrchestrator.sh for ALL responses
- Step 5: Act as the Orchestrator (coordinate, delegate, guide)

### /handoff - Hand off to another agent persona
Direct transition to another persona without session compaction

### /switch - Compact session and switch
Compact current session before switching to another persona

### /wrap - Wrap up current session
Archive session notes and create summary

### /session-note-setup - Set up session notes structure
Initialize session notes directories

### Direct Persona Activation Commands
- `/analyst` - Activate Analyst Agent
- `/pm` - Activate Product Manager Agent
- `/architect` - Activate System Architect Agent
- `/design-architect` - Activate Design Architect Agent
- `/po` - Activate Product Owner Agent
- `/sm` - Activate Scrum Master Agent
- `/dev` or `/developer` - Activate Developer Agent
- `/qa` - Activate QA Agent

## 🧪 TESTING YOUR UNDERSTANDING

Before using with employees, test:
1. Type /ap - Did Claude check notes, create session, and speak?
2. Type /handoff dev - Did Claude transition properly?
3. Check if voice scripts were used for EVERY response
