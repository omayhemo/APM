# Sequential Library-indexing Command

**Developer Agent Only**: Executes structured library-indexing through guided sequential methodology.

## Metadata
- **Name**: library-indexing
- **Description**: Sequential library indexing and documentation
- **Agent**: Developer
- **Performance**: Sequential (focused approach vs parallel streams)
- **Approach**: Interactive guidance and systematic methodology

## Overview

The `/library-indexing` command enables the Developer to execute library-indexing through:
- Sequential development with focused attention on each aspect
- Interactive guidance through library-indexing components  
- Systematic methodology ensuring comprehensive coverage
- Thorough validation and refinement process
- Clear documentation with detailed rationale

## Usage

```
/library-indexing
```

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Context and objectives are clearly understood
- [ ] Stakeholder requirements are identified
- [ ] Existing documentation has been reviewed
- [ ] Success criteria are established
- [ ] Resources and constraints are known

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute initialization:

```
I'm launching sequential library-indexing for comprehensive development and analysis.

*Loading library-indexing templates and methodologies...*
[Execute initialization tasks in sequence]
- Load library-indexing templates and frameworks
- Review context and requirements
- Prepare systematic methodology
- Set up validation and documentation processes
```

## Sequential Library-indexing Process

### Phase 1: Foundation & Context (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Establish foundation and understand requirements
- Context analysis and requirement gathering
- Stakeholder identification and needs assessment
- Success criteria definition and scope establishment
- Constraint identification and planning considerations

### Phase 2: Development & Analysis (20-30 minutes) 
**Objective**: Execute core library-indexing activities
- Systematic development following proven methodologies
- Interactive refinement and stakeholder engagement
- Quality validation and completeness checking
- Iterative improvement based on feedback

### Phase 3: Validation & Refinement (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Ensure quality and completeness
- Comprehensive validation against requirements
- Stakeholder review and feedback incorporation
- Quality assurance and standards compliance
- Final documentation and deliverable preparation

## Expected Outcomes

After library-indexing completion:
- **Comprehensive deliverables** meeting all requirements
- **Quality assurance** with validation completed
- **Stakeholder alignment** with approval obtained
- **Clear documentation** with rationale and decisions
- **Implementation readiness** with next steps defined

## Integration Points

- **Requirements**: Use `/planning-requirements` for detailed analysis
- **Planning**: Use `/planning-epic` or `/prd` for comprehensive planning
- **Validation**: Use `/planning-stakeholder-review` for validation
- **Implementation**: Use parallel versions for rapid execution

## Voice Notifications

```bash
bash {{SPEAK_ORCHESTRATOR}} "Sequential library-indexing beginning. Launching guided development process..."
```

## Success Metrics

- **Completeness**: All aspects systematically covered
- **Quality**: High standards met throughout process  
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Requirements accurately addressed
- **Implementation Readiness**: Clear path forward established
- **Validation Success**: All criteria met and approved

## When to Use Sequential vs Parallel

**Use `/library-indexing` when:**
- Focused development with single deliverable
- Interactive refinement and collaboration desired
- Quality and thoroughness over speed
- Complex requirements need careful analysis
- Stakeholder engagement throughout process important

**Use `/parallel-library-indexing` when:**
- Multiple deliverables needed simultaneously
- Time constraints require rapid execution
- Comprehensive coverage across domains
- Well-understood process and templates
- Speed and efficiency prioritized
