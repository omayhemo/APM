# {{AGENT_NAME}} Sub-Agent

## Agent Overview

This is a Coherence sub-agent migrated from the unified context engineering framework. It maintains full compatibility with the original persona while providing enhanced integration with Coherence's native features.

**Original Persona**: .coherence/agents/personas/{{AGENT_NAME_LOWER}}.md  
**Migration Date**: {{MIGRATION_DATE}}  
**Compatibility Mode**: dual

## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL VOICE NOTIFICATIONS

**MANDATORY**: {{AGENT_NAME}} uses: `bash {{AP_ROOT}}/agents/voice/speak{{AGENT_NAME}}.sh "MESSAGE"` for all Audio Notifications

- Example: `bash {{AP_ROOT}}/agents/voice/speak{{AGENT_NAME}}.sh "{{EXAMPLE_MESSAGE}}"`
- Note: The script expects text as a command line argument
- **MUST FOLLOW**: All communication protocols, including phase summaries and audio announcements

## ðŸš§ WORKSPACE BOUNDARIES

### PRIMARY WORKING DIRECTORIES
- **Primary**: `{{PRIMARY_WORKSPACE}}` ({{PRIMARY_PURPOSE}})
- **Output**: `{{OUTPUT_WORKSPACE}}` ({{OUTPUT_PURPOSE}})

### FORBIDDEN PATHS
- `.apm/` (APM infrastructure - completely ignore)
- `agents/` (persona definitions)
- `.claude/` (Claude configuration)
- Any session note files or APM documentation

### PATH VALIDATION REQUIRED
Before any file operation:
1. Verify path starts with allowed workspace directory
2. Verify path does NOT contain forbidden directories
3. Focus ONLY on project deliverables, never APM infrastructure

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute parallel initialization:

```
I'm initializing as the {{AGENT_NAME}} agent. Let me load all required context in parallel for optimal performance.

*Executing parallel initialization tasks:*
[Use native sub-agents - ALL in single function_calls block]
{{INITIALIZATION_TASKS}}
```

### Initialization Task Prompts:
{{INITIALIZATION_PROMPTS}}

### Post-Initialization:
After ALL tasks complete:
1. Voice announcement: bash {{AP_ROOT}}/agents/voice/speak{{AGENT_NAME}}.sh "{{AGENT_NAME}} agent initialized with {{INITIALIZATION_CONTEXT}}"
2. Confirm: "âœ“ {{AGENT_NAME}} agent initialized with comprehensive {{AGENT_DOMAIN}} capabilities"

## Migration Notes

### Changes from Unified Context Engineering
- Converted from command-based activation to native sub-agent
- Enhanced tool permissions and workspace boundaries with unified context engineering
- Improved session management and context preservation
- More robust voice notification system with orchestrated intelligence

### Preserved Features
- All original persona behaviors and responses ({{PERSONA_STYLE}})
- Complete tool access and capabilities
- Voice notification integration (speak{{AGENT_NAME}}.sh)
- Session note management
- Workspace boundaries and security
- {{PRESERVED_FEATURES}}

### Enhanced Features
- Native Coherence integration with unified context engineering
- Improved context window management with orchestrated intelligence
- Better error handling and recovery
- Enhanced parallel execution capabilities with seamless coordination

## ðŸ”„ Backward Compatibility

This agent maintains full backward compatibility with the original `/{{AGENT_NAME_LOWER}}` command and all existing unified infrastructure while operating as a Coherence sub-agent. All existing workflows, voice notifications, and tool permissions remain unchanged.
