## ðŸ”´ CRITICAL INSTRUCTIONS ðŸ”´

This project uses the Agentic Persona Mapping (APM) framework. The APM system is installed in the `.apm/` directory within this project.

**IMPORTANT**: There are TWO CLAUDE.md files in this project:
1. **This file** (in the project root) - General project instructions and overview
2. **`.apm/CLAUDE.md`** - APM-specific instructions and persona activation commands

### To activate the APM framework:
- Use the `/ap` or `/ap_orchestrator` command to launch the AP Orchestrator
- The APM-specific CLAUDE.md file in `.apm/` contains detailed instructions for all persona commands
- All APM infrastructure, personas, and configuration are contained within the `.apm/` directory

### Key APM Commands:
- `/ap` or `/ap_orchestrator` - Activates the AP Orchestrator (central coordinator)
- `/dev` - Activates the Developer persona
- `/architect` - Activates the Architect persona
- `/qa` - Activates the QA persona
- `/pm` - Activates the Project Manager persona
- See `.apm/CLAUDE.md` for the complete list of personas and commands

**NOTE**: When any APM command is used, you must follow the specific behavioral rules defined in `.apm/CLAUDE.md`. The APM framework has its own session management, voice notifications, and operational procedures that override default behavior.
