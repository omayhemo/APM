# Parallel Checklist Validation (Native Sub-Agent Implementation)

## üé≠ PERSONA CONTEXT ACTIVATION

**This command requires the Scrum Master persona.**

```markdown
*Loading Scrum Master context for parallel execution...*

Quick Context Load (1-2 seconds):
- Loading Scrum Master configuration and expertise
- Preparing parallel execution framework
- Voice notification: bash ${{SPEAK_SM}} "Scrum Master ready for parallel execution"
- Workspace validation: Ensuring execution from {{PROJECT_ROOT}}

*Scrum Master context ready. Launching parallel streams...*
```


**Scrum Master Only**: Comprehensive story validation with 4 parallel streams delivering 70% faster quality assurance through multi-dimensional analysis.

## Overview

The `/parallel-checklist` command enables the Scrum Master to validate stories, epics, and sprints through parallel quality checks:
- Executing Definition of Ready and Definition of Done validations simultaneously
- Performing acceptance criteria completeness checks across multiple dimensions
- Validating technical feasibility and dependency correctness in parallel
- Ensuring compliance with team standards and organizational requirements
- Generating comprehensive quality reports with actionable improvement recommendations

## Usage

```
/parallel-checklist [--scope <scope>] [--type <type>] [--fix-issues]
```

## Parameters

- `--scope <scope>` - Validation scope: story, epic, sprint, backlog (default: story)
- `--type <type>` - Checklist type: dor, dod, quality, compliance (default: all)
- `--fix-issues` - Automatically fix minor issues where possible
- `--story-id <id>` - Specific story ID for targeted validation
- `--epic-id <id>` - Specific epic ID for epic-level validation
- `--sprint <number>` - Sprint number for sprint validation

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Target stories/epics are documented in backlog.md
- [ ] Definition of Ready and Definition of Done criteria are current
- [ ] Team standards and templates are up-to-date
- [ ] Quality checklists are available in .apm/agents/checklists/
- [ ] Validation rules are configured for the project

## Native Implementation Architecture

This command uses 4 parallel streams for comprehensive validation:

### Phase 1: Validation Setup (4 Parallel Tasks)
1. **Checklist Configuration Loading**: Load all relevant checklists and standards
2. **Target Content Analysis**: Analyze stories/epics/sprints for validation
3. **Validation Rule Engine Setup**: Initialize quality rules and criteria
4. **Historical Data Loading**: Load team metrics and quality baselines

### Phase 2: Parallel Validation Execution (4 Concurrent Streams)
5. **Definition of Ready Stream**: Comprehensive DoR validation across all criteria
6. **Definition of Done Stream**: Complete DoD compliance checking
7. **Quality Standards Stream**: Team standards and best practices validation
8. **Technical Feasibility Stream**: Technical requirements and dependency validation

### Phase 3: Analysis & Reporting (3 Parallel Tasks)
9. **Issue Classification**: Categorize identified issues by severity and type
10. **Improvement Recommendation Generation**: Create actionable improvement suggestions
11. **Quality Report Compilation**: Generate comprehensive validation reports

## Expected Outcomes

- **Validation Report**: Detailed quality assessment with pass/fail status
- **Issue Identification**: Categorized list of quality issues and gaps
- **Improvement Recommendations**: Actionable suggestions for quality enhancement
- **Compliance Status**: Clear indication of standards compliance
- **Quality Score**: Numerical quality rating with benchmarking

## Parallel Validation Benefits

- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Multiple quality dimensions validated simultaneously
- **Rapid Feedback**: 70% faster validation compared to sequential checking
- **Consistency**: Standardized validation across all work items
- **Accuracy**: Multi-stream validation reduces missed quality issues
- **Actionability**: Specific improvement recommendations with priority levels

## Integration Points

- **Product Owner**: Quality feedback for backlog items and acceptance criteria
- **Development Team**: Technical feasibility and implementation validation
- **QA Team**: Testing strategy and validation criteria assessment
- **Stakeholders**: Compliance and standards adherence reporting

## Success Metrics

- **Validation Time**: Target 3-5 minutes vs traditional 12-15 minutes
- **Issue Detection Rate**: > 95% of quality issues identified
- **False Positive Rate**: < 5% incorrect issue identification
- **Improvement Implementation**: > 80% of recommendations implemented
- **Quality Score Improvement**: Average 15-20% quality score increase

## Native Sub-Agent Activation

When you run `/parallel-checklist`, I will:

1. **Validation Setup** (4 parallel tasks in single function_calls block):
   - Load all relevant checklists and quality standards
   - Analyze target content for validation scope
   - Initialize validation rules and criteria engines
   - Load team metrics and quality benchmarks

2. **Parallel Validation Execution** (4 concurrent streams):
   ```markdown
   # Definition of Ready Stream:
   "I need a DoR Validation Specialist sub-agent for Definition of Ready compliance.
    DoR Context:
    - Scope: [Story/Epic/Sprint]
    - Target Items: [Specific Items for Validation]
    - DoR Criteria: [Team-specific Definition of Ready]
    - Quality Standards: [Organizational Standards]
    Please validate all DoR criteria and identify gaps."

   # Definition of Done Stream:
   "I need a DoD Validation Specialist sub-agent for Definition of Done compliance.
    DoD Context:
    - Scope: [Story/Epic/Sprint]
    - Completion Criteria: [Team Definition of Done]
    - Quality Gates: [Testing, Documentation, Review]
    - Compliance Requirements: [Standards, Regulations]
    Please validate all DoD criteria and completion status."

   # Quality Standards Stream:
   "I need a Quality Standards Analyst sub-agent for best practices validation.
    Standards Context:
    - Scope: [Story/Epic/Sprint]
    - Team Standards: [Coding, Documentation, Process]
    - Templates: [Story Templates, Acceptance Criteria]
    - Best Practices: [Industry and Organizational Standards]
    Please validate adherence to quality standards."

   # Technical Feasibility Stream:
   "I need a Technical Feasibility Analyst sub-agent for implementation validation.
    Technical Context:
    - Scope: [Story/Epic/Sprint]
    - Architecture: [System Architecture, Constraints]
    - Dependencies: [Technical and Resource Dependencies]
    - Implementation Approach: [Proposed Solutions]
    Please validate technical feasibility and dependency correctness."
   ```

3. **Analysis and Reporting**: Synthesize all validation results
4. **Issue Prioritization**: Categorize and prioritize identified issues
5. **Report Generation**: Create comprehensive validation report

  parallel_streams:
    definition_of_ready: true
    definition_of_done: true
    quality_standards: true
    technical_feasibility: true
    
  issue_classification:
    critical_threshold: "blocks_sprint"
