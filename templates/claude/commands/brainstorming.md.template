## ðŸŽ­ PERSONA CONTEXT ACTIVATION

**This command requires the Analyst persona.**

```markdown
*Loading Analyst context for optimal command execution...*

Quick Context Load (1-2 seconds):
- Loading Analyst configuration and expertise
- Loading relevant templates and frameworks  
- Voice notification: bash ${{SPEAK_ANALYST}} "Analyst context loaded for command execution"
- Workspace validation: Ensuring execution from {{PROJECT_ROOT}}

*Analyst context ready. Proceeding with command...*
```


## Metadata
- **Name**: brainstorming
- **Description**: Sequential brainstorming with guided methodology
- **Agent**: Analyst
- **Performance**: Sequential (focused depth vs parallel breadth)
- **Approach**: Interactive guidance

## Overview

The `/brainstorming` command enables the Analyst to execute creative ideation through:
- Sequential exploration of ideas with focused depth
- Interactive questioning and concept refinement
- Traditional brainstorming techniques with human guidance
- Organic development from kernels to full concepts
- Thoughtful convergence after divergent thinking

## Usage

```
/brainstorming
```

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Problem or challenge is clearly defined
- [ ] Context and constraints are understood
- [ ] Goal or desired outcome is established
- [ ] Open mindset for creative exploration

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute initialization:

```
I'm launching sequential brainstorming for creative ideation and concept development.

*Loading brainstorming context and methodologies...*
[Execute initialization tasks in sequence]
- Load brainstorming methodologies and techniques
- Review problem context and objectives
- Prepare creative thinking frameworks
- Set up ideation and evaluation processes
```

## Sequential Brainstorming Process

### Phase 1: Problem Understanding (5-10 minutes)
**Objective**: Deeply understand the challenge and context
- Explore the problem space through open-ended questions
- Identify constraints, opportunities, and success criteria
- Clarify assumptions and gather relevant background
- Define the scope and boundaries for ideation

### Phase 2: Divergent Thinking (15-25 minutes)
**Objective**: Generate diverse ideas without judgment
- Apply "Yes And..." techniques to build on concepts
- Encourage wild ideas and unconventional approaches
- Use creative prompts and lateral thinking triggers
- Explore multiple perspectives and scenarios
- Capture all ideas without immediate evaluation

### Phase 3: Idea Development (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Expand promising concepts into fuller ideas
- Select interesting kernels from initial generation
- Develop ideas through guided questioning
- Add detail, context, and potential implementation paths
- Explore variations and combinations of concepts
- Document emerging themes and patterns

### Phase 4: Convergent Evaluation (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Assess and prioritize ideas thoughtfully
- Evaluate ideas against established criteria
- Consider feasibility, impact, and alignment
- Identify most promising concepts for further development
- Note ideas requiring additional research or validation
- Create actionable next steps

## Brainstorming Techniques Available

### Creative Ideation Methods
- **Free Association**: Stream-of-consciousness idea generation
- **Mind Mapping**: Visual exploration of concept relationships
- **SCAMPER**: Systematic creativity through guided questions
- **Random Stimulus**: Using unexpected triggers for new ideas
- **Role Playing**: Exploring ideas from different perspectives

### Problem Reframing
- **5 Whys**: Deep exploration of root causes
- **Assumption Challenging**: Questioning fundamental beliefs
- **Perspective Shifting**: Viewing from different stakeholder angles
- **Constraint Removal**: Imagining without limitations
- **Analogy Thinking**: Drawing inspiration from other domains

### Evaluation Frameworks
- **Impact vs Effort**: Simple prioritization matrix
- **Feasibility Assessment**: Technical and resource evaluation
- **Strategic Alignment**: Fit with goals and values
- **Risk Analysis**: Potential downsides and mitigation
- **Innovation Potential**: Uniqueness and breakthrough possibility

## Interactive Guidance Style

This command emphasizes **collaborative exploration**:
- **Socratic questioning** to unlock deeper insights
- **Building on user input** rather than generating independently  
- **Encouraging exploration** of adjacent possibilities
- **Providing frameworks** while maintaining creative freedom
- **Balancing structure** with organic idea development

## Expected Outcomes

After brainstorming session:
- **Comprehensive idea inventory** with documented concepts
- **Developed concepts** with initial detail and context
- **Evaluation summary** with prioritized opportunities
- **Action plan** for pursuing most promising ideas
- **Creative foundation** for continued development

## Output Format

```markdown
# Brainstorming Session Results

## Session Overview
- **Challenge**: [Problem or opportunity explored]
- **Duration**: [Time invested]
- **Approach**: Sequential guided brainstorming

## Ideas Generated
### High-Potential Concepts
1. **[Idea Name]**
   - Description: [Concept overview]
   - Potential Impact: [Expected value]
   - Next Steps: [How to advance]

2. **[Idea Name]**
   - Description: [Concept overview]
   - Potential Impact: [Expected value]  
   - Next Steps: [How to advance]

### Additional Ideas for Future Consideration
- [Idea]: [Brief description]
- [Idea]: [Brief description]
- [Idea]: [Brief description]

## Key Insights
- [Pattern or theme discovered]
- [Unexpected connection identified]
- [Assumption challenged]

## Recommended Next Steps
1. [Immediate action for top idea]
2. [Research or validation needed]
3. [Additional brainstorming sessions planned]

## Creative Notes
[Capture interesting tangents, creative sparks, or ideas that need more development]
```

## Integration Points

- **Follow-up Analysis**: Use `/parallel-requirements` to develop top concepts
- **Research Planning**: Use `/research-prompt` for validation planning  
- **Stakeholder Input**: Use `/stakeholder-review` to gather feedback
- **Project Development**: Transition to `/epic` or `/prd` for implementation

## Voice Notifications

```bash
bash {{AP_ROOT}}/voice/speakAnalyst.sh "Sequential brainstorming session beginning. Ready for creative exploration and guided ideation..."
```

## Success Metrics

- **Idea Quality**: Depth and development of concepts generated
- **Creative Coverage**: Breadth of problem space explored
- **User Engagement**: Level of collaborative participation
- **Actionability**: Clear next steps for promising ideas
- **Foundation Building**: Strong base for continued development

## When to Use Sequential vs Parallel

**Use `/brainstorming` when:**
- Deep exploration of complex problems
- Interactive collaboration desired
- Quality over quantity approach
- Building understanding alongside ideation
- Human creativity and intuition emphasized

**Use `/parallel-brainstorming` when:**
- Rapid idea generation needed
- Comprehensive coverage required
- Multiple perspectives simultaneously
- Time constraints exist
- Maximum creative output desired
