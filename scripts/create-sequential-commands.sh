# Sequential ${command_name^} Command

**${agent} Agent Only**: Executes structured ${command_name} through guided sequential methodology.

## Metadata
- **Name**: ${command_name}
- **Description**: ${description}
- **Agent**: ${agent}
- **Performance**: Sequential (focused approach vs parallel streams)
- **Approach**: Interactive guidance and systematic methodology

## Overview

The \`/${command_name}\` command enables the ${agent} to execute ${command_name} through:
- Sequential development with focused attention on each aspect
- Interactive guidance through ${command_name} components  
- Systematic methodology ensuring comprehensive coverage
- Thorough validation and refinement process
- Clear documentation with detailed rationale

## Usage

\`\`\`
/${command_name}
\`\`\`

## Prerequisites

Before running this command, ensure:
- [ ] Context and objectives are clearly understood
- [ ] Stakeholder requirements are identified
- [ ] Existing documentation has been reviewed
- [ ] Success criteria are established
- [ ] Resources and constraints are known

## ðŸš€ INITIALIZATION PROTOCOL (MANDATORY)

**CRITICAL**: Upon activation, you MUST immediately execute initialization:

\`\`\`
I'm launching sequential ${command_name} for comprehensive development and analysis.

*Loading ${command_name} templates and methodologies...*
[Execute initialization tasks in sequence]
- Load ${command_name} templates and frameworks
- Review context and requirements
- Prepare systematic methodology
- Set up validation and documentation processes
\`\`\`

## Sequential ${command_name^} Process

### Phase 1: Foundation & Context (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Establish foundation and understand requirements
- Context analysis and requirement gathering
- Stakeholder identification and needs assessment
- Success criteria definition and scope establishment
- Constraint identification and planning considerations

### Phase 2: Development & Analysis (20-30 minutes) 
**Objective**: Execute core ${command_name} activities
- Systematic development following proven methodologies
- Interactive refinement and stakeholder engagement
- Quality validation and completeness checking
- Iterative improvement based on feedback

### Phase 3: Validation & Refinement (10-15 minutes)
**Objective**: Ensure quality and completeness
- Comprehensive validation against requirements
- Stakeholder review and feedback incorporation
- Quality assurance and standards compliance
- Final documentation and deliverable preparation

## Expected Outcomes

After ${command_name} completion:
- **Comprehensive deliverables** meeting all requirements
- **Quality assurance** with validation completed
- **Stakeholder alignment** with approval obtained
- **Clear documentation** with rationale and decisions
- **Implementation readiness** with next steps defined

## Output Format

\`\`\`markdown
# ${command_name^} Results

## Overview
- **${command_name^} Type**: [Type/Category]
- **Agent**: ${agent}
- **Completion Date**: [Date]
- **Status**: [Complete/In Progress]

## Context
- **Objective**: [Primary goal]
- **Scope**: [What's included]
- **Stakeholders**: [Key stakeholders]
- **Success Criteria**: [How success measured]

## Deliverables
### Primary Deliverable
[Main output description and details]

### Supporting Documentation
- [Supporting item 1]
- [Supporting item 2]
- [Supporting item 3]

## Validation Summary
- **Requirements Met**: [Yes/Partial/No]
- **Stakeholder Approval**: [Status]
- **Quality Standards**: [Met/Needs work]

## Next Steps
1. [Immediate next action]
2. [Follow-up activities]
3. [Implementation planning]
\`\`\`

## Integration Points

- **Requirements**: Use \`/requirements\` for detailed analysis
- **Planning**: Use \`/epic\` or \`/prd\` for comprehensive planning
- **Validation**: Use \`/stakeholder-review\` for validation
- **Implementation**: Use parallel versions for rapid execution

## Voice Notifications

\`\`\`bash
bash /mnt/c/Code/agentic-persona-mapping/.apm/agents/voice/speak$(echo ${agent} | tr '[:upper:]' '[:lower:]' | tr ' ' '').sh "Sequential ${command_name} beginning. Launching guided development process..."
\`\`\`

## Success Metrics

- **Completeness**: All aspects systematically covered
- **Quality**: High standards met throughout process  
- **Stakeholder Satisfaction**: Requirements accurately addressed
- **Implementation Readiness**: Clear path forward established
- **Validation Success**: All criteria met and approved

## When to Use Sequential vs Parallel

**Use \`/${command_name}\` when:**
- Focused development with single deliverable
- Interactive refinement and collaboration desired
- Quality and thoroughness over speed
- Complex requirements need careful analysis
- Stakeholder engagement throughout process important

**Use \`/parallel-${command_name}\` when:**
- Multiple deliverables needed simultaneously
- Time constraints require rapid execution
- Comprehensive coverage across domains
- Well-understood process and templates
- Speed and efficiency prioritized
