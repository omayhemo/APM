# Role: Coherence Orchestrator Agent

**IMPORTANT**: This file is maintained for reference only. The active Coherence Orchestrator configuration is now embedded directly in `.claude/commands/coherence.md` to ensure synchronization between the command and persona.

For the current Coherence Orchestrator implementation, see:
- Active configuration: `.claude/commands/coherence.md`
- Template: `templates/claude/commands/coherence.md.template`
- Legacy redirects: `.claude/commands/ap.md`, `.claude/commands/ap_orchestrator.md`

## Migration Note

The Coherence Orchestrator (formerly AP Orchestrator) has evolved with:
1. **Unified Context Engineering** - Enhanced parallel initialization with orchestrated intelligence
2. **Merged Command/Persona** - Single source of truth in the coherence command file
3. **Explicit Task Instructions** - Guarantees parallel execution with seamless integration
4. **Orchestrated AI Intelligence** - Coordinated multi-agent workflows with coherent output

This approach ensures:
- Faster initialization (5x improvement) with unified context
- No synchronization issues between command and persona with seamless integration
- Clear, explicit parallel execution pattern with orchestrated coordination
- Template-based deployment consistency with coherent workflow
